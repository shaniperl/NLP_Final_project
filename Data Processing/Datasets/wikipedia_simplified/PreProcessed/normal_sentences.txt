Some species of lizard also utilize bright colors , such as the iridescent patches on the belly of Sceloporus .
The particular innovation in this respect is the dewlap , a brightly colored patch of skin on the throat , usually hidden between scales .
When a display is needed , the lizards erect the hyoid bone of their throat , resulting in a large vertical flap of brightly colored skin beneath the head which can be then used for communication .
Sight is very important for most lizards , both for locating prey and for communication , and , as such , many lizards have highly acute color vision .
Most lizards rely heavily on body language , using specific postures , gestures , and movements to define territory , resolve disputes , and entice mates .
These colors would be highly visible to predators , so are often hidden on the underside or between scales and only revealed when necessary .

The original Temple of Jupiter was still awaiting restoration when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 , burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash .
As the most important divinity in Ancient Rome , many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad ( consisting of Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva ) in towns newly conquered by the Romans .
It maintained much of its autonomy , however , until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC .
The temple structure had been built in 150 BC to dominate the forum , and it became Pompeii 's main temple after the Roman conquest .
Pompeii was occupied by the Romans beginning in 310 BC .
This held true for Pompeii , where the previously existing Temple of Jupiter was enlarged and Romanized upon conquest .
The excavated temple can still be seen in Pompeii today .
In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii , destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter .
The interior of the temple contained the cella , which held the statues of Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva , and which only the priests were permitted to enter .
Pompeii was transformed into a much more public and open place .
The architecture of the town had been largely influenced by the Greeks , but Roman rule would soon lead to alterations in this style .
Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome , where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state .

Initially dedicated to Jupiter alone , it was erected in the mid 2nd century BC at the same time as the temple of Apollo was being renovated this was the era at which Roman influence over Pompeii increased and so Roman Jupiter superseded the Greek Apollo as the town 's highest god .
Public buildings and spaces would come to dominate the city .

As a result of a twentieth century effort by architects and decorators to strip the parlor of its burial and mourning associations , helped by the advent of funeral parlors , in most homes the parlor has been replaced by the living room .
The `` inner parlors '' in 1 Chronicles 28:11 in the Bible were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the Temple ( 1 Kings 6:5 ) , `` side chambers '' , or they may have been , as some think , the porch and the holy place .
In modern use , the parlor is a formal sitting room in a large house or mansion .
The term Parlour has even been seen to describe a coffee shop as the `` coffee parlor . ''
It was generally located in the west range of the buildings of the cloister , close to the main entrance .
In the late nineteenth century , it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions , and closed during the week .
The ` outer parlor ' was the room where the monks or nuns could receive a visitor and conduct business with outsiders .
The ` inner parlor ' was located off the cloister next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery .
In medieval Christian usage , the parlor was one of two rooms in a monastery .
`` Parlour '' is also used in other settings , such as `` Beer parlor '' , wine parlor , or , in at least one case , `` Spaghetti parlor . '' The term Parlour has even been seen to describe a coffee shop as the `` coffee parlor . ''
The parlor contained a family 's best furnishings , works of art and other display items .
Most orders required a general silence in the cloister , which was the place where the monks engaged in study , and the inner parlor was a convenient place for the monks to engage in conversation freely .

However , as historians of science such as Michael Ghiselin and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out , none of these views were original to Lamarck .
The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by some as an artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought , repeated in textbooks without analysis .
Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists `` re read Lamarck , cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics inheritance of acquired characters to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself . ''
Gould advocated defining `` Lamarckism '' more broadly , in line with Lamarck 's overall evolutionary theory .
He argued that `` the restriction of `` Lamarckism '' to this relatively small and non distinctive corner of Lamarck 's thought must be labeled as more than a misnomer , and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system '' .
On the contrary , Lamarck 's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution .

A Linux distribution is a member of the family of Unix like operating systems built on top of the Linux kernel . Such distributions ( often called distros for short ) are Operating systems including a large collection of software applications such as word processors , spreadsheets , media players , and database applications .
The operating system will consist of the Linux kernel and , usually , a set of libraries and utilities from the GNU project , with graphics support from the X Window System .
Users were attracted to Linux distributions as alternatives to the DOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems on the PC , Mac OS on the Apple Macintosh , and proprietary versions of Unix .
SLS was not well maintained , so Patrick Volkerding released a distribution based on SLS , which he called Slackware , released in 1993 .
Examples of packages are a library for handling the PNG image format , a collection of fonts or a web browser .
Over three hundred of those are in active development , constantly being revised and improved .
Distributions are normally segmented into packages .
Distributions optimized for size may not contain X and tend to use more compact alternatives to the GNU utilities , such as Busybox , uClibc , or dietlibc .
There are currently over six hundred Linux distributions .
Linux distributions began to appear very soon after the Linux kernel was first used by individuals other than the original Linux programmers who were more interested in developing the operating system than developing application programs , the user interface , or convenient packaging .
Before the first Linux distributions , a would be Linux user was required to be something of a Unix expert , needing to know not only what libraries and executables were required to successfully get the system to boot and run , but also important details concerning configuration and placement of files in the system .
Each package contains a specific application or service .

Each lichen is a flat patch bordered by a black line of spores .
If the growth rate is known , the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited .
Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists in determining the relative age of deposits , e.g. moraine systems , thus revealing evidence of glacial advances .
Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age , such as gravestones , historic or prehistoric rock buildings , or moraines of known age ( e.g. those deposited during the Little Ice Age ) .
Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual .
These patches grow adjacent to each other , leading to the appearance of a map or a patchwork field .
The map lichen is a species of lichen , Rhizocarpon geographicum , which grows on rocks in mountainous areas of low air pollution .
The process is termed lichenometry .
White holes appear in the theory of eternal black holes .
They attract matter like any other mass , but objects falling towards a white hole would never actually reach the white hole 's event horizon ( though in the case of the maximally extended Schwarzschild solution , discussed below , the white hole event horizon in the past becomes a black hole event horizon in the future , so any object falling towards it will eventually reach the black hole horizon ) . In quantum mechanics , the black hole emits Hawking radiation , and so can come to thermal equilibrium with a gas of radiation .

That is , any problem in NP can be reduced in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine to the problem of determining whether a Boolean formula is satisfiable .
An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability , then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving all problems in NP .
The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science .

The Banksia genus was first described and named by Carolus Linnaeus the Younger in his April 1782 publication Supplementum Plantarum ; hence the full name for the genus is `` Banksia L.f. '' The genus name honors the English botanist Sir Joseph Banks , who collected the first Banksia specimens in 1770 , during James Cook 's first expedition .
These Australian wildflowers and popular garden plants are easily recognized by their characteristic flower spikes and fruiting `` cones '' and heads . When it comes to size , banksias range from prostrate woody shrubs to trees up to 30 metres tall .

The Pale Kangaroo Mouse burrows only in fine sand , while the Dark Kangaroo Mouse prefers fine , gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil .
A kangaroo mouse is either one of the two species of jumping mouse ( genus Microdipodops ) native to the deserts of the Southwestern United States , predominantly found in the state of Nevada .
Kangaroo mice are nocturnal , and are most active in the two hours following sunset .
The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats , which belong to the same subfamily , Dipodomyinae .
Interestingly , the mouse never drinks water , instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats .
They are believed to hibernate during cold weather .
The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large caches in their burrows , which are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet ( 1 to 2.5 meters ) .
The name `` kangaroo mouse '' refers to the species ' extraordinary jumping ability , as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion .
The burrow , the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours , is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young .
The Dark Kangaroo Mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion .
Both species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems , and forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat .
The two species are :

Jack Brabham 's 1966 drivers ' championship remains the only such achievement using a car bearing the driver 's own name .
Midway through the 1992 season , the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing .
The Brabham team was founded by Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac , who met in 1951 while both were successfully building and racing cars in their native Australia .
During this period , teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three and competed in the Indianapolis 500 .
Motor Racing Developments Ltd. , commonly known as Brabham , was a British racing car manufacturer and Formula One racing team .
Ecclestone sold the team in 1988 .
British businessman Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s , and later became responsible for administrating the commercial aspects of Formula One .
The team won two more Formula One drivers ' championships in the 1980s with Brazilian Nelson Piquet , and became the first to win a drivers ' championship with a turbocharged car .
In the 1970s and 1980s , Brabham introduced innovations such as the ` fan car ' , which won its only race before being withdrawn , in race refuelling , carbon brakes , and hydropneumatic suspension .
Founded in 1960 by two Australians , driver Jack Brabham and designer Ron Tauranac , the team won four drivers ' and two constructors ' world championships in its 30 year Formula One history .
The case was investigated by the UK Serious Fraud Office .
Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group , a Japanese engineering firm .
In the 1960s , Brabham was the world 's largest manufacturer of open wheel racing cars for sale to customer teams , and had built more than 500 cars by 1970 .

Oceanic anoxic events or anoxic events occur when the Earth 's oceans become completely depleted of oxygen ( O2 ) below the surface levels .
Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past .
There are currently several places on earth that are exhibiting the features of anoxic events on a localized level such as algae blooms and localized `` dead zones '' .
Dead zones exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay , in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat , the Black Sea ( which may have been anoxic in its deepest levels for millennia , however ) , in the northern Adriatic as well as a dead zone off the coast of Louisiana .
It is believed oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to lapses in key oceanic current circulations , to climate warming and greenhouse gases .
Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past . Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions .
Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions .
Typically , oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years , before a full recovery .
These mass extinctions were so characteristic they include some of those which geobiologists employ to serve as a time marker in biostratigraphic dating .

Cores , allowing an insight into the evolution of the chert over time , were drilled in 1988 and 1997 , accompanied by further trenching efforts , which unearthed the Windyfield chert .
The chert was formed when silica rich water from volcanic springs rose rapidly and petrified the early terrestrial ecosystem , in situ and almost instantaneously , in much the same fashion that organisms are petrified by hot springs today although the astounding fidelity of preservation has not been found in recent deposits .
It is exposed near the village of Rhynie , Aberdeenshire , Scotland ; a second unit , the Windyfield chert , is located some 700 m away .
Hot springs , with temperatures between 90 t , were active in a number of episodes ; the water had probably cooled to under 30 C before it reached the fossilised organisms .
The chert was discovered by William Mackie while mapping the western margin of the Rhynie basin in 1910 â `` 1913 .
Their activity is preserved in 53 beds , 80 m thick on average , over a 35.41 m sequence , interbedded with sands , shales and tuffs which speak of local volcanic activity .
Deposition was very rapid .
The Rhynie chert contains exceptionally preserved plant , fungus , lichen and animal material preserved in place by an overlying volcanic deposit .
The oldest known insect ( Rhyniognatha hirsti ) , which resembles the modern springtails , was found in the Rhynie chert , pushing dates for the origination of insects back to the Silurian period .

It was early days Moog work and it did take a bit of time '' .
I 've got some thoughts on this one . '
I remember George saying , ` You 've taken three days , it 's only a song . '

`` Maxwell 's Silver Hammer '' is my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue , as it so often does , as I was beginning to find out at that time in my life .
`` In the past I may have written tongue in cheek , like ` Maxwell 's Silver Hammer ' , and dealt with matters of fate in a kind of comical , parody manner .
We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens . ''
Over the following two days the group overdubbed vocals , piano , Hammond organ , anvil and guitar .
I do n't know why it was silver , it just sounded better than Maxwell 's hammer .
Paul McCartney commented : `` The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell 's Silver Hammer .
John Lennon later recalled , `` I hate it ... He did everything to make it into a single , and it never was and it never could have been . ''
It just so happens in this batch of songs I would look at these subjects and thought it was good for writing .
In 1977 Harrison was more candid , describing it as `` so fruity '' but added `` we did a good job on it '' .
After reconvening to record the Abbey Road album , The Beatles began recording Maxwell 's Silver Hammer at Abbey Road Studios on 9 July 1969 .
The length of time it took to record the song created tension between The Beatles .
George Harrison described it in 1969 as `` one of those instant whistle along tunes which some people hate , and other people really like .
`` Maxwell 's Silver Hammer '' is a song by The Beatles , on the Abbey Road album , with Paul McCartney singing lead .
I wanted something symbolic of that , so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer .
If it 's good enough to take to your psychiatrist , it 's good enough to make a song of . ''
It was needed for scanning .
McCartney , Harrison and Starr taped 16 takes of the rhythm track , followed by a series of guitar overdubs .
It 's a fun song , but it 's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher , and then , finally , the judge . ''

In November 1511 Ferdinand II and his son in law King Henry VIII of England signed the Treaty of Westminster , pledging mutual aid between the two against France .
After Philip 's death in 1506 , with Joanna supposedly mentally unstable , and her and Philip 's son the future Charles V was only six years old , Ferdinand resumed the regency , ruling through Francisco JimÃ nez de Cisneros , the Chancellor of the Kingdom .
Ferdinand II served as the latter 's regent during her absence in the Netherlands , ruled by her husband Archduke Philip .
Another less famous `` conquest '' took place in 1503 , when Andreas Paleologus , de jure Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire , left Ferdinand and Isabella as heirs to the empire , thus Ferdinand became de jure Imperator Constantinopolitanus .
Although the French were victorious against Venice at the Battle of Agnadello , the League of Cambrai soon fell apart , as both the Pope and Ferdinand II became suspicious of French intentions .
The agreement soon fell apart , and over the next several years , Ferdinand 's great general Gonzalo FernÃ ndez de CÃ rdoba conquered Naples from the French , having succeeded by 1504 .
The latter part of Ferdinand 's life was largely taken up with disputes over control of Italy with successive Kings of France , the so called Italian Wars .
In 1494 , Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and expelled Alfonso II ( who was Ferdinand 's first cousin once removed and stepson of Ferdinand 's sister ) from the throne of Naples .
The Holy League was generally successful in Italy , as well , driving the French from Milan , which was restored to its Sforza dukes by the peace treaty in 1513 .
After Isabella 's death in 1504 , her kingdom went to their daughter Joanna .
Ferdinand allied with various Italian princes and with Emperor Maximilian I , to expel the French by 1496 and install Alfonso 's son , Ferdinand , on the Neapolitan throne .
The French were successful in reconquering Milan two years later , however .
In 1508 war resumed in Italy , this time against the Republic of Venice , which all the other powers with interests on the Italian peninsula , including Louis XII , Ferdinand II , Maximilian , and Pope Julius II joined together against as the ` League of Cambrai ' .
When Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479 , the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union creating for the first time since the 8th century a single political unit referred to as EspaÃ a ( Spain ) , the root of which is the ancient name Hispania .
Ferdinand the Catholic ( 10 March 1452 23 January 1516 ) was King of Aragon ( 1479 â `` 1516 , as Ferdinand II ) , Sicily ( 1468 â `` 1516 ) , Naples ( 1504 â `` 1516 ) , Valencia , Sardinia , and Navarre , Count of Barcelona , jure uxoris King of Castile ( 1474 â `` 1504 , as Ferdinand V , in right of his wife , Isabella ) and then Regent of that country also from 1508 to his death , in the name of his mentally unstable daughter Joanna the Mad .
Earlier that year , Ferdinand had conquered the southern half of the Kingdom of Navarre , which was ruled by a French nobleman , and annexed it to Spain .
In 1501 , following the death of Ferdinand II of Naples and his succession by his uncle Frederick , Ferdinand of Aragon signed an agreement with Charles VIII 's successor , Louis XII , who had just successfully asserted his claims to the Duchy of Milan , to partition Naples between them , with Campania and the Abruzzi , including Naples itself , going to the French and Ferdinand taking Apulia and Calabria .
The two young monarchs were initially obliged to fight a civil war against Joan , princess of Castile ( also known as Juana la Beltraneja ) , the purported daughter of Henry IV , and were swiftly successful .

Parallel computer programs are more difficult to write than sequential ones , because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs , of which race conditions are the most common .
Parallelism has been employed for many years , mainly in high performance computing , but interest in it has grown lately due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling .
As power consumption ( and consequently heat generation ) by computers has become a concern in recent years , parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture , mainly in the form of multicore processors .
Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically one of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance .

However , the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes remain unclear . ''
In the mid 1980s , Syvanen predicted that lateral gene transfer existed , had biological significance , and was involved in shaping evolutionary history from the beginning of life on Earth .
However , Richardson and Palmer ( 2007 ) state : `` Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes .
Most thinking in genetics has focused upon vertical transfer , but there is a growing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a highly significant phenomenon and amongst single celled organisms perhaps the dominant form of genetic transfer .
Artificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering .
Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) , also Lateral gene transfer ( LGT ) , is any process in which an organism incorporates genetic material from another organism without being the offspring of that organism .
There is some evidence that even higher plants and animals have been affected and this has raised concerns for safety .
By contrast , vertical transfer occurs when an organism receives genetic material from its ancestor , e.g. , its parent or a species from which it has evolved .
Horizontal gene transfer was first described in Japan in a 1959 publication that demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different species of bacteria .
The phenomenon appears to have had some significance for unicellular eukaryotes as well .

There is a tendency for males to be larger than the females ; however , exceptions in which the females tend to be heavier than the males include the Bush Duiker , Dwarf Antelope , Cape Grysbok , and Oribi , all rather small species .
Species of forest , woodland , or bush tend to be sedentary , but many of the plains species undertake huge migrations .
Many antelope are sexually dimorphic .
A group of antelope is called a herd .
The gnus and gazelles of East Africa perform some of the most impressive mass migratory circuits of all mammals .
The pronghorn antelope of North America is not a member of the family Bovidae , but the family Antilocapridae and not a true antelope .
These migrations enable grass eating species to follow the rains and therefore their food supply .
True antelope have horns which are unbranched and never shed , while Pronghorns have branching horns , and shed annually .
There are 91 species , most of which are native to Africa , in about 30 genera .
In most species , both sexes have horns , but those of males tend to be larger .

Dromornis lived in Australia from the late Miocene to the early Pliocene , therefore meaning that early humans never encountered this genus .
Its legs were powerful , but it is not believed to have been a fast runner .
This species had a long neck and stub like wings , rendering it flightless .
However , recently others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore .

It is derived from the Latin arma , meaning weapons and statium , meaning a stopping .
An armistice is a modus vivendi and is not the same as a peace treaty , which may take months or even years to agree on .

A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice .
The most notable armistice , simply known by Europeans as `` The Armistice '' , was the armistice at the end of World War I , on 11 November 1918 , signed near CompiÃ gne , France , and effective at the `` eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month . ''
An armistice is a situation in a war where the warring parties agree to stop fighting .

( An example of the latter one is ` One for all , and all for one ' ( '' Ð Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ð Ð Ð Ñ Ð Ñ

They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and can not therefore all be correct .
Versions such as these are referred to as the logical problem of evil .
This assertion leads to a polytheistic interpretation of Christianity where god is not omnipotent , but since Plantinga 's goal is to defeat only the assertion that God and evil are logically incompatible , even a highly implausible but possible , coherent instance of God 's coexistence with evil is sufficient for his purposes .
Many philosophers accept that arguments such as Plantinga 's free will defense ( in brief , that possibly God allows evil in order to achieve the ultimately greater good of free will ) successfully solve the logical problem of evil in terms of human action ; the question of how free will and God 's Omniscience are compatible remains , however ( see the Argument from free will ) .
Some responses include the arguments that true free will can not exist without the possibility of evil , that humans can not understand God , that suffering is necessary for spiritual growth or evil is the consequence of a fallen world .

At the request of his father , Adolf Lorenz , he began a premedical curriculum in 1922 at Columbia University , but he returned to Vienna in 1923 to continue his studies at the University of Vienna .
Lorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad .
Lorenz also predicted the relationship between market economics and the threat of ecological catastrophe .
He arrived back in Altenberg `` with manuscript and bird intact . ''
In his autobiographical essay , published in 1973 in Les Prix Nobel ( winners of the prizes are requested to provide such essays ) , Lorenz credits his career to his parents , who `` were supremely tolerant of my inordinate love for animals , '' and to his childhood encounter with Selma Lagerlof 's The Wonderful Adventures of Nils , which filled him with a great enthusiasm about wild geese .
If our senses gave us wrong information about our environment , we would soon be extinct .
He sought to be a motorcycle mechanic , but instead he was assigned as a medic .
Lorenz states that humanity is the one species not bound by these mechanisms , being the only one that has defined its own environment : '' ( The pace of human ecology ) is determined by the progress of man 's technology ( p35 ) ... human ecology ( economy ) is governed by mechanisms of POSITIVE feedback , defined as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to attenuate it ( p43 ) .
Lorenz died on February 27 , 1989 , in Altenberg .
Another of his contributions to ethology is his work on imprinting .
His scientific work appeared mainly in journal articles , written in German ; they became widely known to English speaking scientists through the descriptions of it in Tinbergen 's 1951 book The Study of Instinct , though many of his papers were later published in English translation in the two volumes titled Studies in Geese and Waste Behavior .
The manuscript became his book Behind the Mirror .
He shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine `` for discoveries in individual and social behavior patterns '' with two other important early ethologists , Nikolaas Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch .
When he was repatriated , he was allowed to keep the manuscript of a book he had been writing , and his pet starling .
His influence on a younger generation of ethologists ; and his popular works , were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public .
Lorenz joined the Nazi Party in 1938 and accepted a university chair under the Nazi regime .
Thus pain and pleasure act as checks on each other : `` To gain a desired prey , a dog or wolf will do things that , in other contexts , they would shy away from : run through thorn bushes , jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them .
In 1940 he became a professor of psychology at the University of KÃ nigsberg .
His answer comes from evolutionary biology .
Konrad Zacharias Lorenz ( November 7 , 1903 in Vienna February 27 , 1989 in Altenberg , Vienna ) was an Austrian zoologist , ethologist , and ornithologist .
All these inhibitory mechanisms ... act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms ... The organism can not allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying '' .
In 1969 , he became the first recipient of the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca .
Together with Nikolaas Tinbergen , Lorenz developed the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors ( fixed action patterns ) .
Lorenz 's best known books are King Solomon 's Ring and On Aggression , both written for a popular audience .
In this book , Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth .
He graduated as Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) in 1928 and became an assistant professor at the Institute of Anatomy until 1935 .
He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941 .

He was Captured by the Russians very near the start of his service and became a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from 1942 to 1948 .
It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species , animal or vegetable , which constitutes its prey .
In captivity he continued to work as a medic and `` got quite friendly with some Russians , mostly doctors . ''
Influenced by the ideas of William McDougall , Lorenz developed this into a `` psychohydraulic '' model of the motivation of behavior , which tended towards group selectionist ideas , which were influential in the 1960s .
... It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species ... '' pp31 â `` 33 .
In his application for membership to the Nazi party NSDAP he wrote in 1938 : `` I 'm able to say that my whole scientific work is devoted to the ideas of the National Socialists . ''
In his 1973 book Behind the Mirror : A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge , Lorenz considers the old philosophical question of whether our senses correctly inform us about the world as it is , or provide us only with an illusion .
Lorenz studied instinctive behavior in animals , especially in greylag geese and jackdaws .
`` The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality ... Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole , but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual .
Indeed , he states that : `` A completely new ( ecology ) which corresponds in every way to ( humanity 's ) desires ... could , theoretically , prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention ( 36 ) .
`` A closer examination shows that these beings ... not only do not damage each other , but often constitute a community of interests .

The term heterodox is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings , but voice this disagreement while still maintaining the overall value of the tradition .
As an adjective , heterodox is commonly used to describe a subject as `` characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards '' ( status quo ) .
Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views , either on doctrinal or social issues .
A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment .
The belief is not orthodox , as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants ; however , it is also not heresy , as the Church accepts that such a scenario might be possible .
The heterodox Christian therefore remains in the tradition and attempts to stimulate constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree .
Heterodoxy is generally defined as `` any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position '' .
In the Eastern Orthodox Church , the term is used to refer to Christian churches not belonging to the Eastern Orthodox communion and holding doctrines different from those of Orthodox Christianity .
For example , the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain , and `` the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God '' ( Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261 ) .
For example , in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches heterodoxy may describe beliefs that differ from strictly orthodox views but that fall short of heresy .

The presidency armies , like the presidencies themselves , belonged to the Company until the Indian Mutiny of 1857 , when the Crown took over all three presidencies .

A second or third subdivision level is referred to with another number each .
The standard is developed and regulated by the European Union , and thus only covers the member states of the EU in detail .

In physiology , transduction is the conversion of a stimulus from one form to another .
The light causes a conformational change in a protein called rhodopsin .
For example , in the visual system , sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina convert the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain .
Thus , in this example , more light hitting the photoreceptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses , effectively communicating that stimulus to the brain .

As technology increased and demand for the resources remained high , catches far exceeded the sustainable limit for whale stocks .
In 1986 the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) banned commercial whaling so that stocks might recover . While the moratorium has been successful in averting the extinction of whale species due to overhunting , contemporary whaling is subject to intense debate .
Whaling is the hunting of whales mainly for meat and oil .
In the late 1930s more than 50,000 whales were killed annually and by the middle of the century whale stocks were not being replenished .
The reason for the moratorium ( on commercial whaling ) was scientific uncertainty about the number of whales .
In 1986 the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) banned commercial whaling so that stocks might recover .
Its earliest forms date to at least 3000 BC .
Anti whaling countries and environmental groups contend that those stocks remain vulnerable and that whaling is immoral , unsustainable , and should remain banned permanently .

The Vienna Philharmonic ( in German : Wiener Philharmoniker ) is an orchestra in Austria , regularly considered one of the finest in the world .
During Richter 's tenure , the orchestra gave the premieres of the 2nd and 3rd symphonies of Johannes Brahms , and the 8th symphony of Anton Bruckner .
Each New Year 's Day since 1 January 1941 , the VPO has sponsored the Vienna New Year 's Concerts , dedicated to the music of the Strauss family composers , and particularly that of Johann Strauss II .
These have included a great many of the world 's best known conductors , including Richard Strauss , Arturo Toscanini , Hans Knappertsbusch , Wilhelm FurtwÃ ngler , John Barbirolli , Carlo Maria Giulini , Georg Solti , Erich Kleiber , James Levine , Zubin Mehta , Carlos Kleiber , Claudio Abbado , Riccardo Muti , Nikolaus Harnoncourt , Pierre Boulez , Lorin Maazel , Mariss Jansons , Daniel Barenboim and Valery Gergiev .
Since 1933 , the orchestra has had no single principal conductor , but instead has a number of guest conductors .
Three conductors , however , were particularly associated with the post war era : Herbert von Karajan and Karl BÃ hm , who were made honorary conductors , and Leonard Bernstein , who was made an honorary member of the orchestra .
He gave a series of four subscription concerts , and since then , the orchestra has given concerts continuously .
The orchestra can trace its origins to 1842 , when Otto Nicolai formed the Philharmonische Academie ; which was a fully independent orchestra and which took all its decisions by a democratic vote of all its members .
From 1875 to 1898 Hans Richter was principal conductor , except for the season 1882 1883 when he was in dispute with the orchestral committee .
Gustav Mahler held the post from 1898 to 1901 , and under his baton the orchestra played abroad for the first time at the 1900 Paris World Exposition .
Subsequent conductors were Felix Weingartner , Wilhelm FurtwÃ ngler and Clemens Krauss .

He claims that in Hitler 's `` RÃ hm Purge '' speech to the Reichstag on July 13 , 1934 , the third group of `` pathological enemies of the state '' that Hitler lists are , in fact , the Freikorps fighters .
Between World War I and World War II the term was also used for the paramilitary organizations that arose during the period of the Weimar Germany .
Freikorps leaders symbolically gave their old battle flags to Hitler 's Sturmabteilung ( SA ) and Schutzstaffel ( SS ) on November 9 , 1933 in a huge ceremony .
Historian Robert Waite claims that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps .
The meaning of the word `` freikorps '' changed over time .
They were also used to defeat the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919 .
They received considerable support from Minister of Defense Gustav Noske , a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany , who used them to crush the German Revolution and the Marxist Spartacist League and arrest Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg , who were killed on 15 January 1919 .
Numerous future members and leaders of the Nazi Party had served in the Freikorps , including Ernst RÃ hm , future head of the Sturmabteilung , or SA , Heinrich Himmler , future head of the Schutzstaffel , or SS , and Rudolf HÃ Ã , the future Kommandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp .
In 1920 , Adolf Hitler had just begun his political career as the leader of the tiny and as yet unknown German Workers Party ( soon renamed the National Socialist German Workers Party , NSDAP ) in Munich .
Many of the Freikorps had joined the SA , so when the Night of the Long Knives came , they were among those targeted for killing or arrest , including Ehrhardt and RÃ hm .
The Freikorps were regarded as unreliable by regular armies , so they were mainly used as sentries and for minor duties .
The first Freikorps were recruited by Frederick II of Prussia in the 18th century during the Seven Years ' War .
Hermann Ehrhardt , founder and leader of Marinebrigade Ehrhardt , and his deputy Commander Eberhard Kautter , leaders of the Viking League , refused to help Hitler and Erich Ludendorff in their Beer Hall Putsch and conspired against them .

In a 1982 case involving hereditary deafness , the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to endorse the child 's right to sue for wrongful life , but in the same decision , limited the child 's recovery to special damages .
Historically , only parents could sue for their own damages incurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child ( e.g. , the mother 's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents ' emotional distress resulting from the realization that their child was disabled ) .
This cause of action is known as wrongful birth .
Typically a child and the parents will sue a doctor or a hospital for failing to provide information about the disability during the pregnancy , or a genetic disposition before the pregnancy .
In four U.S. states , the child is allowed to bring a wrongful life cause of action for such damages .
Most other jurisdictions , including New York , England and Ontario , have refused to allow the wrongful life cause of action .

The choice of Bonn was made mainly due to the advocacy of Konrad Adenauer , a former Cologne Mayor and Chancellor of West Germany after World War II , who came from that area , despite the fact that Frankfurt already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt .
Because of its relatively small size for a capital city , Bonn was sometimes referred to , jokingly , as the Bundeshauptstadt ohne nennenswertes Nachtleben ( Federal capital without noteworthy night life ) or the ` Bundesdorf ' ( Federal Village ) .
It 's used for receptions of guests of the town , and as a bureau for the mayor .
This axis is interrupted by a railway line and Bonn Hauptbahnhof , a building erected in 1883\/84 .
Beethoven 's birth place is located in Bonngasse near the market place .

Next to the market place is the Old Town Hall , built in 1737 in Rococo style , under the rule of Clemens August of Bavaria .
They held that both the Bible and Christian tradition taught that alcohol is a gift from God that makes life more joyous , but that overindulgence leading to drunkenness is a sin .
Today , all three of these positions exist in Christianity , but the historic position remains the most common worldwide .
In the mid 19th century , some Protestant Christians moved from this historic position of allowing moderate use of alcohol ( sometimes called moderationism ) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances ( abstentionism ) or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it was believed to be a sin ( prohibitionism ) .
The biblical languages have several words for alcoholic beverages , and though prohibitionists and some abstentionists ( see `` Current views '' below ) dissent , there is a broad consensus that the words did ordinarily refer to intoxicating drinks .
Since nearly all Christians base their views of alcohol in whole or in part on their understanding of what the Bible says about it , the Bible is an important source on the subject , along with Jewish and Christian traditions which start with the Bible and expand upon it .
Negatively , wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler , and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God 's judgment and wrath .
Positively , wine is used as a symbol of abundance and physical blessing , for example .

Moreover , given the often political IAL environment in which those that speak a language are not merely language users but adherents to its system and linguistic philosophy as well , there are two categories of those that know the language , Ido speakers and Ido supporters . Ido resembles Esperanto to a large extent , and many Esperantists have learned Ido out of curiosity while still not using it , preferring to support the more well known Esperanto movement instead .

This territory , under the Arab name Al Andalus , became first an Emirate and then an independent Umayyad Caliphate , the Caliphate of CÃ rdoba , after the overthrowing of the dynasty in Damascus by the Abbasids .
The Mughal Empire declined in 1707 after the death of Aurangzeb and was officially abolished by the British after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 .
When the Caliphate dissolved in 1031 , the territory split into small Taifas , and gradually the Christian kingdoms started the Reconquest up to 1492 , when Granada , the last kingdom of Al Andalus fell under the Catholic Monarchs .
Wars were between the Byzantine Empire and at first the Rashidun and then the Umayyad caliphates and resulted in the conquest of the Greater Syria , Egypt , North Africa and Armenia ( Byzantine Armenia and Sassanid Armenia ) .
The Muslim conquests brought about the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and a great territorial loss for the Byzantine Empire .
Most historians agree that the Sassanid Persian and Byzantine Roman empires were militarily and economically exhausted from decades of fighting one another .
In Sub Saharan Africa , the Sahelian kingdom expanded Muslim territories far from the coast .
The modern era saw the rise of three powerful Muslim empires : the Ottoman Empire of the Middle East and Europe , the Safavid Empire of Persia and Central Asia , and the Mughal Empire of India ; along with their contest and fall to the rise of the colonial powers of Europe .

It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard et al . in 2000 , and given the temporary designation .
Erinome is about 3.2 kilometres in diameter , and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 22,986 Mm in 711.965 days , at an inclination of 164 Â to the ecliptic ( 162 Â to Jupiter 's equator ) , in a retrograde direction and with an eccentricity of 0.2552 .
Erinome belongs to the Carme group , made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165 Â .

In 1861 , over 40 years after his death , the ride became the subject of `` Paul Revere 's Ride '' , a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow .
He and William Dawes were instructed by Dr. Joseph Warren to ride from Boston to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams of the movements of the British Army , which was beginning a march from Boston to Lexington , ostensibly to arrest Hancock and Adams and seize the weapons stores in Concord .
At 10 pm on the night of April 18 , 1775 , Revere received instructions from Dr. Joseph Warren to ride to Lexington to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams of the British approach .
Paul Revere ( May 10 , 1818 ) was an American silversmith and a patriot in the American Revolution .
On the night of April 18 â `` 19 , 1775 , just hours before the battles of Lexington and Concord , Revere performed his `` Midnight Ride '' .
Drogue chutes are used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle ( a fixed wing aircraft , or a drag racer ) , or to provide stability ( tandem free fall , or space shuttle after a touchdown ) .
Only slightly later , a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus ( fol .
Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently .
Exact numbers are difficult to estimate , but approximately one in a thousand sports main parachute openings malfunction , and must be cut away , although some skydivers have many hundreds of jumps and never cut away .
According to the historian of technology Lynn White , these conical and pyramidal designs , much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia , mark the origin of `` the parachute as we know it '' .
The feasibility of Leonardo 's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by the British Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by another skydiver .
If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in death because the main parachute might fail to deploy correctly or fully .
Parachutes can malfunction in several ways .
Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary `` main '' parachutes .
In the U.S. and many developed countries , emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by `` riggers '' who must be trained and certified according to legal standards .
Leonardo 's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame , which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal .
In the U.S. , the average fatality rate is considered to be about 1 in 80,000 jumps .
This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction , although the possibility of a main malfunction that can not be cut away causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk .
Most skydivers also equip themselves with small barometric computers ( known as an AAD or automatic activation device like Cypres , FXC or Vigil ) that will automatically activate the reserve parachute if the skydiver himself has not deployed a parachute to reduce his rate of descent by a preset altitude .
They are also designed more conservatively , and are built and tested to more exacting standards , making them more reliable than main parachutes .
Malfunctions can range from minor problems that can be corrected in flight and still be landed , to catastrophic malfunctions that require the main parachute to be cut away using a modern 3 ring release system , and the reserve be deployed .
A parachute is carefully folded , or `` packed '' to ensure that it will open reliably .
However , the primary safety advantage of a reserve chute comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction being multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction .
Here , the scale of the parachute is in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper .
It is not known whether the Italian inventor was influenced by the earlier design , but he may have learned about the idea through the intensive oral communication among artist engineers of the time .
Beginning on 20 November 1923 , 1,000,000,000,000 old Marks were exchanged for 1 Rentenmark so that 4.2 Rentenmarks were worth 1 US dollar , exactly the same rate the Mark had in 1914 .
In December 1923 the exchange rate was 4,200,000,000,000 Marks to 1 US dollar .
In 1922 , the highest denomination was 50,000 Mark . By 1923 , the highest denomination was 100,000,000,000,000 Mark .

In the negative connotation , compromise may be referred to as capitulation , referring to a `` surrender '' of objectives , principles , or material , in the process of negotiating an agreement .
To compromise is to make a deal where one person gives up part of his or her demand .
In human relationships `` compromise '' is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with , this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little .
Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system .
Research has indicated that suboptimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party and settle for suboptimal agreements .
Extremism is often considered as antonym to compromise , which , depending on context , may be associated with concepts of balance , tolerance .
Mutually better outcomes can often be found by careful investigation of both parties ' interests , especially if done early in negotiations .

Henry Spencer Moore OM CH FBA ( 30 July 1898 â `` 31 August 1986 ) was an English sculptor and artist .
He became well known through his larger scale abstract cast bronze and carved marble sculptures , and was instrumental in introducing a particular form of modernism to the United Kingdom .
Moore was born in Castleford , the son of a mining engineer .
His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces .
Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace , Yorkshire .
Moore 's works are usually suggestive of the female body , apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups .
Yet he lived frugally and most of the money he earned went towards endowing the Henry Moore Foundation , which continues to support education and promotion of the arts .
His ability in later life to fulfill large scale commissions made him exceptionally wealthy .
He was best known for his abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art .

This is particularly visible in snakes , which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey .
The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds , the extant archosaurs .
From morphological data , Iguanid lizards have been thought to have diverged from other squamates very early , but recent molecular phylogenies , both from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , do not support this early divergence .
Squamates are a monophyletic group that is a sister group to the tuatara .
It has been shown that snake venom evolved via a process by which a gene encoding for a normal body protein , typically one involved in key regulatory processes or bioactivity , is duplicated , and the copy is selectively expressed in the venom gland .
Natural Selection has driven the origination and diversification of the toxins to counter the defenses of their prey .
Venom has been known in the families Caenophidia , Anguimorpha , and Iguania and has been shown that it evolved a single time along these lineages before the three families diverged because all lineages share nine common toxins .
Once toxins have been recruited into the venom proteome , they form large multigene families and evolve via the birth and death model of protein evolution , which leads to a diversification of toxins that allows the sit and wait predators the ability to attack a wide range of prey .
Members of the order are distinguished by their skins , which bear horny scales or shields .
Recent research suggests that the evolutionary origin of venom may exist deep in the squamate phylogeny , with 60 % of squamates placed in this hypothetical group called Toxicofera .
They are the most variably sized order of reptiles , ranging from the 16 mm ( 0.63 in . )
Squamate fossils first appear in the early Jurassic , but a mitochondrial phylogeny suggests that they evolved in the late Permian .
The evolutionary relationships within the squamates are not yet completely worked out , with the relationship of snakes to other groups being most problematic .
Of these , the lizards form a paraphyletic group ( since `` lizards '' excludes the sub clade of snakes ) .
They also possess movable quadrate bones , making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase .
Because snakes have a faster molecular clock than other squamates , and there are few early snake and snake ancestor fossils , it is difficult to resolve the relationship between snakes and other squamate groups .
In newer classifications the name Sauria is used for reptiles and birds in general , and the Squamata are divided differently :

Ironically , Hitler attended performances that included Jewish and foreign singers , long after they had been banned from all other venues across Germany .
Following Wagner 's death , his widow Cosima continued running the festival at one or , more frequently , two year intervals .
Winifred 's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter ( at her behest ) to the anti fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini , begging him to lead the festival .
Present at this unique musical event were Kaiser Wilhelm , Dom Pedro II of Brazil , King Ludwig ( who attended in secret , probably to avoid the Kaiser ) , and other members of the nobility , as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche who committed much effort to helping his then good friend Wagner establish the festival , and such accomplished composers as Anton Bruckner , Edvard Grieg , Pyotr Tchaikovsky , and Franz Liszt .
Following the war , Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court for her support of the Nazi party .
In the 1920s , well before the rise of the Nazi party , Winifred Wagner became a strong supporter and close personal friend of Adolf Hitler .
After Cosima 's retirement in 1906 , Siegfried Wagner took over management of the festival , introducing new staging and performance styles .
The Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held annually in Bayreuth , Germany , at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are presented .
Two thirds of the town of Bayreuth was destroyed by Allied bombing in the final days of World War II , though the theater itself was undamaged .
During the war , the festival was turned over to the Nazi party , which continued to sponsor operas for wounded soldiers returning from the front .
Toscanini refused .
These soldiers were forced to attend lectures on Wagner before the performances , and most found the festival to be tedious .
She gradually introduced the remaining operas which complete the Bayreuth canon of Wagner 's last ten completed operas .
Because of this support , Bayreuth was able to maintain some artistic independence under the Third Reich , despite the use of Wagner 's works as Nazi propaganda tools .
The inauguration took place on August 13 , 1876 , with a performance of Das Rheingold .
The Supreme court or highest court in the territory is Court of Final Appeal ( Macau ) .
Since the late 1990s , household income has fallen slightly .
This means that the share the most economically prosperous type of household has been dwindling in the United States .
Unlike the median household income , which divides all households in two halves , the mean income is the average income earned by American households .
While median household income has a tendency to increase up to four persons per household , it declines thereon after .
Overall , households headed by Hispanics and African Americans or Blacks were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles .
The median income per member of household for this particular group was $ 27,924 .
In 2004 the median household income in the United States was $ 44,389 .
The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent , but in the lowest quintile , the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one .
The median income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income .
The median household income rose by 30 % while the income for the 20th percentile ( the lower threshold for the second lowest quintile ) rose by only 28 % from $ 14,002 to $ 17,984 .
In the case of mean income , the income of all households is divided by the number of all households .
Those with doctorates had the second highest median household with a median of $ 96,830 ; $ 18,289 more than that for those at the Master 's degree level , but $ 3,170 lower than the median for households with a professional degree holding householder .
Cross referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families .
Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles , compared to the general population of households .
These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons , increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64 .
Household type is strongly correlated with household income .
Household income as well as per capita income in the United States rise significantly as the educational attainment increases .
Considering other racial and geographical differences in regards to household income , it should come as no surprise that the median household income varies with race , size of household and geography .
Overall , the median household income rose from $ 33,338 in 1967 to an all time high of $ 44,922 in 1999 , and has since decreased slightly to $ 43,318 .
In 1972 , disposable personal income was determined to be $ 4,129 ; $ 19,385 in 2005 dollars .
Between 1999 and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since 2004 .
Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintiles ; single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles .
The southern states had , by far , the lowest median household income , with nine of the country 's fifteen poorest states located in the South .
The residents of the household do not have to be related to the head of the household for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
While educational attainment did not help reduce the income inequality between men and women , it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes , enabling many households with one or more graduate degree householders to enter the top household income quintile .
In 1990 , the median household income was $ 30,056 or $ 44,603 in 2003 dollars .
In 1969 , more than 40 % of all households consisted of a married couple with children .

( These exceptions are ignored by some Asian computer systems that systematically display quotation marks with the included spacing , as this spacing is part of the fixed width characters . )
Single or double quotation marks denote either speech or a quotation .
Regardless of its placement , only one end mark ( ?
The two may , however , in these cases , be to some degree interchangeable .
Nesting levels up to five can be found in the Bible .
When available , however , the prime should be used instead ( e. g. , 5 â 6 â , and 40 Â 20 â 50 â ) .
When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text , a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence , such as a colon or closing punctuation .
The important rule is that the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched :
â HAL said , `` Good morning , Dave , '' â recalled Frank .
When quoted text is interrupted , such as with the phrase he said , a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption , and an opening quotation mark after .
As noted below , in some older texts , the quotation mark is repeated every line , rather than every paragraph .
`` HAL , '' noted Frank , `` said that everything was going extremely well . ''
In these cases , questions arise about the form ( and names ) of the quotation marks to be used .
Quotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century , and were used copiously by some printers by the seventeenth .
In some languages , if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string , the quotation marks are doubled .
Quotation marks are used for multiple paragraph quotations in some cases , especially in narratives .
It is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech .
The logic for this derives from the need to distinguish use forms , coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms .
Other languages use an escape character , often the backslash , as in ` eat ` hot ' dogs ' .
However , these three characters have quite different purposes .
In Early Modern English , quotation marks were used only to denote pithy comments .
In the first centuries of typesetting , quotations were distinguished merely by indicating the speaker , and this can still be seen in some editions of the Bible .
Quotation marks or inverted commas ( informally referred to as quotes or speech marks ) are punctuation marks at the beginning and end of a quotation , direct speech , literal title or name .
This usage can be confused with ironic or altered usage quotation , sometimes with unintended humor .
For instance , 5 feet and 6 inches is often written 5 ' 6 '' , and 40 degrees , 20 arcminutes , and 50 arcseconds is written 40 Â 20 ' 50 '' .
Neither style â '' single or double â '' is an absolute rule , though double quotation marks are preferred in the United States , and both single and double quotation marks are used in the United Kingdom .
Yes , he did say , `` He said , â Good morning .
Both systems have the same rules regarding question marks , exclamation points , colons and semicolons .
One can skirt these limitations , however , by using the HTML character codes or entities .
In the first two sentences above , only one punctuation mark is used at the end of each .
`` Cheese '' is derived from a word in Old English .
For example to represent the string eat ` hot ' dogs in Pascal one uses ` eat hot dogs ' .
In fiction , both styles are the same .
Straight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters .
Long quotations were also set this way , at full size and full measure .
When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other , proper spacing for legibility requires that a non breaking space be inserted .
Cheese is derived from milk .
They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes .
`` HAL said , â Good morning , Dave , â '' recalled Frank .
As a rule , a whole publication would be italicised , whereas the titles of minor works ( such as poems or short stories inside the collection ) would be written with quotation marks .
When this practice was abandoned , the empty margin remained , leaving the modern form of indented block quotation .
Incorrect : HAL said that `` Everything was going extremely well . ''
Quotation marks , rather than italics , are generally used for the titles of shorter works .
There is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word , or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word .
The convention in English is to give opening quotation marks to the first and each subsequent paragraph , using closing quotation marks only for the final paragraph of the quotation , as in the following example from Pride and Prejudice :
If such a passage is further quoted in another publication , then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level .
During the Renaissance , quotations were distinguished by setting in a typeface contrasting with the main body text ( often Italic type with roman , or the other way round ) .
To avoid the potential for confusion between ironic quotes and direct quotations , some style guides specify single quotation marks for this usage , and double quotation marks for verbatim speech .
In some Baroque and Romantic period books , they would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation .
The lunch lady plopped a glob of `` food '' onto my tray .
The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity .
Some implementations incorrectly produce an opening single quotation mark in places where an apostrophe is required , for example , in abbreviated years like â 08 for 2008 .
The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms , thus :
In English , when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text , a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol , such as a dash , requires that there be no space .
Commas are also often used before and after the interruption , more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text :
This style of punctuation is common in the U.S. and Canada .
By 1749 , single quotation marks , or inverted commas , were commonly used to denote direct speech .
Quotes indicating irony , or other special use , are sometimes called scare , sneer , shock , distance , or horror quotes .
They first began to quote direct speech in 1714 .
They differ on the treatment of periods and commas .
Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style ; however , many styles , especially for poetry , prefer the use of single quotation marks .
Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts ( one such example being YouTube ) .
Quotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense .
`` Good morning , Frank , '' greeted HAL .
With regard to quotation marks adjacent to periods and commas , there are two styles of punctuation in widespread use .
In all major forms of English , question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside or outside quoted material depending on whether they apply to the whole sentence or just the quoted portion , but colons and semicolons are always placed outside .
Crystals somehow `` know '' which shape to grow into .
He shared his `` wisdom '' with me .
For example , For sale : `` fresh '' fish , `` fresh '' oysters , could be construed to imply that fresh is not used with its everyday meaning , or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh .
In some languages ( e. g. Pascal ) only one type is allowed , in some ( e. g. C and its derivatives ) both are used with different meanings and in others ( e. g. Python ) both are used interchangeably .
Cheese has calcium , protein , and phosphorus .
Only the period , however , can not end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the enclosing sentence , except for literal text :
Straight quotation marks ( or italicized straight quotation marks ) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime , e. g. , when signifying feet and inches , arcminutes and arcseconds or minutes and seconds , where the quotation mark symbolises the latter part of the pair .
can end a sentence .
This is because a paraphrase is not a direct quote , and in the course of any composition , it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea .
The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe and similar to the prime symbol .
Quotes are sometimes used for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics , most commonly on signs or placards .
The Chicago Manual of Style , 15th edition , acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 7.58 , `` Quotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard , ironic , or other special sense ( â ) They imply â This is not my term , â or â This is not how the term is usually applied .
Correct : HAL said that everything was going extremely well .
In most cases , quotations that span multiple paragraphs should be set as block quotations , and thus do not require quotation marks .
â Good morning , Frank , â greeted HAL .

When dealing with direct speech , American rules place periods and commas inside the quotation marks all the time , but the alternative usage varies .
The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first .
Either quotation marks or italic type can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself rather than its associated concept .
Sometimes , quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation .

The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding .
Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity , Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via discrete units of inheritance , which are now called genes .
However , the modern science of genetics , which seeks to understand the process of inheritance , only began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid 19th century .
When studying human genetic diseases , geneticists often use pedigree charts to represent the inheritance of traits .

In the midst of these negotiations , the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact .
Napoleon himself occupied Berlin , causing the king , queen and the rest of the royal family to flee , despite Louise 's illness , in the dead of winter to KÃ nigsberg in the easternmost part of the kingdom .
Napoleon reportedly remarked the king `` has lost his best minister . ''
Louise 's untimely death left her husband alone during a period of great difficulty , as the Napoleonic Wars and need for reform continued .
On 19 July 1810 , while visiting her father in Strelitz , the Queen died in her husband 's arms from an unidentified illness .
The queen 's subjects attributed the French occupation as the cause of her early death .
Napoleon had previously attempted to destroy her reputation by questioning Louise 's marital fidelity , but the queen met him anyway , attempting to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms .
On the journey there , there was no food or clean water , and the king and queen were forced to share the same sleeping arrangements in `` one of the wretched barns they call houses '' , according to one witness traveling with them .
Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg Strelitz ( Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie ; 10 March 1776 19 July 1810 ) was Queen consort of Prussia as the wife of King Frederick William III .
Though Prussia had not fought in a war since 1795 , its military leaders were confident that they could win against Napoleon 's troops .
Prussian troops began mobilizing , culminating in the October 1806 Battle of Jena Auerstedt , which was a disaster for Prussia , as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out .
After a small incident concerning an anti French pamphlet occurred , King Frederick William was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the French emperor .
Formerly Louise had regularly referred to him as `` the Monster '' , but nevertheless made a request for a private interview with the emperor , whereon she threw herself at his feet ; though he was impressed by her grace and determination , Napoleon refused to make any concessions , writing back to his wife Empress JosÃ phine that Louise `` is really charming and full of coquettishness toward me .
Queen Louise 's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression became well admired by future generations .
After various events took place , Napoleon demanded , from a highly superior position , peace terms in what was to be called the Peace of Tilsit ( 1807 ) .
As the king felt that her presence might put Napoleon in a `` more relaxed mood '' ; Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit , but only to save `` her Prussia . ''

Like Hollandaise sauce , there are several methods for the preparation of BÃ arnaise sauce .
Alternatively , the flavorings may be added to a finished Hollandaise ( sans lemon juice ) .
The sauce 's name refers to the BÃ arn region , a former province now in the dÃ partement of PyrÃ nÃ es Atlantiques , in southwestern France .
BÃ arnaise sauce is frequently erroneously referred to as Bernaise sauce , as if it were from Bern , the capital city of Switzerland , which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins .
The most common preparation is a bain marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks .
It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect .
BÃ arnaise is a traditional sauce for steak .
A BÃ arnaise sauce is simply clarified butter , an egg yolk , a shallot , a little tarragon vinegar .
Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine , vinegar , shallots , fresh chervil , fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns ( later strained out ) , with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice .
Others are similar .
Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France , a gourmet himself , who was born in the former province of BÃ arn .
In appearance it is light yellow and opaque , smooth and creamy .
Here we highlight the differences .
The difference is only in their flavoring : BÃ arnaise uses shallot , chervil , peppercorn , and tarragon , while Hollandaise uses lemon juice .
It is considered to be a ` child ' of the mother Hollandaise sauce , one of the five sauces in the French haute cuisine mother sauce repertoire .

Number 2 fuel oil is a distillate home heating oil .
Number 3 fuel oil was a distillate oil for burners requiring low viscosity fuel .
The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , heavier than gasoline and naphtha .
Fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue .
Trucks and some cars use similar diesel fuel with a cetane number limit describing the ignition quality of the fuel .
Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases .
In this sense , diesel is a type of fuel oil .
Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes and aromatics .
Viscosity also increases with number , and the heaviest oil has to be heated to get it to flow .
Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael , , is a United States Supreme Court case that applied the Daubert standard to expert testimony from non scientists .
Three months later , the Carmichaels sued the manufacturer of the tire , claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the accident .
The district court found the tire expert 's methods not to be scientifically valid , and hence excluded his testimony .
This resulted in a conclusion that Kumho Tire would rightly prevail .
The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court 's ruling .
The Carmichaels ' case rested largely on testimony from a tire failure expert .
Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire expert 's methodology , and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence .
The tire failure expert relied on features of tire technology that the manufacturer did not dispute , as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels ' van .
The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit .
The district court took its cue from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals , which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert testimony .
Patrick Carmichael was driving his minivan on July 6 , 1993 , when the right rear tire blew out .
One of the passengers in the vehicle died , and others were severely injured .
Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether Daubert applied solely to scientific evidence .
The tire expert 's testimony rested on such unscientific `` observation and experience '' , and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on their legal reasoning over Rule 702 without the Daubert gloss .
The expert 's conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed .
Under Daubert , certain factors contribute to the reliability , and hence the admissibility , of expert testimony , one of which is the general validity of the expert 's methods .

The Late Heavy Bombardment ( commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm , or LHB ) is a period of time approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon , and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus , and Mars as well .
Nevertheless , some argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga , and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected by a single large impact basin .
The evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of time .

Hermione is a Cybele asteroid and orbits beyond most of the main belt asteroids .
As a C type , it is probably composed of carbonaceous materials .
A satellite of Hermione was discovered in 2002 with the Keck II telescope , and is about 8 miles ( 13 km ) in diameter .
Hermione was discovered by J. C. Watson on May 12 , 1872 from Ann Arbor , and named after Hermione , daughter of Menelaus and Helen in Greek mythology .
Of several proposed shape models that agreed with the images , a `` snowman '' like shape was found to best fit the observed precession rate of Hermione 's satellite .
The asteroid has a bi lobed shape , as evidenced by adaptive optics images , the first of which were taken in December 2003 , with the Keck telescope .
121 Hermione is a very large asteroid of the dark C spectral type , orbiting in the Cybele group in the far outer main belt .

The title was imported to the monarchies of medieval Europe , and in many countries developed into a high military rank and great officer of State ( e.g. , the Constable of France ) .
The office of constable can vary significantly in different jurisdictions .
Historically , a constable could also be someone in charge of the defense of a castle .
Even today , there is a Constable of the Tower of London .
The equivalent position is that of Marshal , which derives from Old High German marah `` horse '' and schalh `` servant '' , and originally meant `` stable keeper '' , which has a similar etymology .
However , in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office holder at the parish level .
Most constables in modern jurisdictions are law enforcement officers ; in the United Kingdom , Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries , a constable is the lowest rank of police officer ( it is also , when preceded by the term ` sworn ' , used to describe any police officer with arrest and other powers ) , while in the United States a constable is generally an elected peace officer with lesser jurisdiction than a sheriff .
A constable is a person holding a particular office , most commonly in law enforcement .
If a constable is not appointed as a constable with peace officer powers , they can only serve civil processes .
Historically , the title comes from the Latin comes stabuli ( count of the stables ) and originated from the Eastern Roman Empire ; originally , the constable was the officer responsible for keeping the horses of a lord or monarch .
Diving nearly vertically at the target , in the same direction the bombs will take , the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed .
A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the bomb it drops .
This tactic also gave the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot ; armor was typically heaviest near the waterline and thin or non existent on the deck .
Additionally , no complicated precision bomb sight is needed for targeting .
In addition , dive bombing allowed relatively small aircraft carrying limited bomb loads to inflict disproportionately heavy damage .
Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges .
It was opposed by 11 Southern slave states that had declared a secession to join together to form the Confederacy .
During the American Civil War , the Union was a name used to refer to the federal government of the United States , which was supported by the twenty free states and five border slave states .
Although the Union states included the Western states of California , Oregon , and ( after 1864 ) Nevada , as well as states generally considered to be part of the Midwest , the Union has been also often loosely referred to as `` the North '' , both then and now .

Excommunication is a religious censure used to deprive or suspend membership in a religious community .
Censures and sanctions sometimes follow excommunication ; these include banishment , shunning , and shaming , depending on the religion , the offense that caused excommunication , or the rules or norms of the religious community .
In some religions , excommunication includes spiritual condemnation of the member or group .
The word means putting ( someone ) out of communion .

In the coiling method of construction , all of the energy required to form the main part of a piece is supplied indirectly by the hands of the potter .
A potter 's wheel may occasionally be referred to as a `` potter 's lathe '' . However , that term is better used for another kind of machine that is used for a different shaping process , turning , similar to that used for shaping of metal and wooden articles .
In Ancient Egyptian mythology , the deity Khnum was said to have formed the first humans on a potter 's wheel .
A potter 's wheel may occasionally be referred to as a `` potter 's lathe '' .
The wheel may also be used during process of trimming the excess body from dried ware and for applying incised decoration or rings of color .
Many early ceramics were hand built using a simple coiling technique in which clay was rolled into long threads that were then pinched and beaten together to form the body of a vessel .

Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist , and was also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism .
Buddhism was also practiced in the Punjab and Sindh regions .
There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat .
Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet .
Most Buddhists in Punjab reverted to Hinduism from 600 AD onwards .
The Swat Valley , known in antiquity as Uddiyana , was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara .
The Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District , which was then a part of Uddiyana .
Buddhism was the faith practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayad Caliphate in 710 AD .
Gandhara remained a largely Buddhist land until around 800 AD , when the Pashtun people invaded the region from Southern Afghanistan and introduced the Islamic religion .
The region that is today known as Pakistan once had a large Buddhist population , with the majority of people in Gandhara ( present day North Western Pakistan and Eastern Afghanistan ) being Buddhist .

A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state .
For example , if a 128 bit block cipher received separate 32 bit bursts of plaintext , three quarters of the data transmitted would be padding .
Various schemes have been proposed to increase the security of LFSRs .
The use of LFSRs on their own , however , is insufficient to provide good security .
In the most common form , binary digits are used ( bits ) , and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation ( XOR ) .
Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware complexity .
Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers .
Another approach is to tag the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output .
Single digit errors are limited in their effect , affecting only up to N plaintext digits .
A one time pad uses a keystream of completely random digits .
An alternative name is a state cipher , as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state .
Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non linear filtering function .
In a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time , and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption .
The latter device can then be designed and used in less stringent environments .
To restore synchronisation , various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption .
Various properties of such a combining function are critical for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme , for example , in order to avoid correlation attacks .
If a block cipher ( not operating in a stream cipher mode ) were to be used in this type of application , the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity , since block ciphers can not directly work on blocks shorter than their block size .
If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission , synchronisation is lost .
In a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages , and then combined with the plaintext ( to encrypt ) or the ciphertext ( to decrypt ) .
Another approach uses several of the previous N ciphertext digits to compute the keystream .
In practice , the digits are typically single bits or bytes .
However , this comes at a cost : because the keystream is now pseudorandom , and not truly random , the proof of security associated with the one time pad no longer holds : it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure .
Such schemes are known as self synchronizing stream ciphers , asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey ( CTAK ) .
This can be alleviated by buffering the output .
In a synchronous stream cipher , the sender and receiver must be exactly in step for decryption to be successful .
An example of a self synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher feedback ( CFB ) mode .
The idea of self synchronization was patented in 1946 , and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits , making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream .
Based on this key , it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar fashion to the one time pad .
This output is then ( in some versions ) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate .
Instead of a linear driving device , one may use a nonlinear update function .
A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient key â '' 128 bits , for example .
One approach to introducing non linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly , controlled by the output of a second LFSR .
However , stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly : see stream cipher attacks â '' in particular , the same starting state must never be used twice .
This mechanism suffers from timing attacks on the second generator , since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator 's state .
One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a `` 1 '' , otherwise it repeats its previous output .
Normally LFSRs are stepped regularly .
If , however , a digit is corrupted in transmission , rather than added or lost , only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message .
Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers ( LFSRs ) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be readily analyzed mathematically .
Such generators include the stop and go generator , the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator .
Because LFSRs are inherently linear , one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of several parallel LFSRs into a non linear Boolean function to form a combination generator .
This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high ; however , it makes it less likely the error would be detected without further mechanisms .
In cryptography , a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream ( keystream ) , typically by an exclusive or ( xor ) operation .
Moreover , because of this property , synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks â '' if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext , he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit ; for example , flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped in the plaintext .
Block ciphers operate on large blocks of digits with a fixed , unvarying transformation .
The stop and go generator ( Beth and Piper , 1984 ) consists of two LFSRs .
Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding , while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by naturally operating on the smallest unit that can be transmitted ( usually bytes ) .
Another advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated in a separate box that is subject to strict security measures and fed to other devices , e.g. a radio set , which will perform the xor operation as part of their function .
For example , Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions ( T Functions ) with a single cycle on n bit words .
This is termed a binary additive stream cipher .

Composers such as Orlando Gibbons , John Blow , Sigismund von Neukomm , and Henry Purcell wrote voluntaries , although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as fancy ( an English form of the Italian word fantasia ) , or even fugue .
The music that an organist plays before and after a service is always called a voluntary .
In music a voluntary is a piece of music , usually for organ , which is played as part of a church service .
However , these fugues were not composed in the proper fugue style : they just started off with imitation as in a fugue , but continued in a freer style .
The title was often used by English composers in the late Renaissance or Baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style , i.e. it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue .

The physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel , is termed external ballistics .
The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet 's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel .
The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material , the angle of incidence , and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet itself .
Mould manufacturers such as RCBS , Paul Jones Moulds , and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs .
Bullets must be produced to a high standard , as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy .
With a mould , bullets can be made at home for reloading one 's own ammunition , where local laws allow .
Bullets must have a surface which will form this seal without causing excessive friction .
Actual bullet shapes are many and varied , and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds .
Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead .
The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging the gun 's bore .
These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy , however the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries .
They must first form a seal with the gun 's bore .
Bullet designs have to solve two primary problems .
These interactions between bullet and bore are termed internal ballistics .
Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins .
With smooth bore firearms , a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented , it presented a uniform front .
Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically .
Hand casting , however , is only time and cost effective for solid lead bullets .
If a strong seal is not achieved , gas from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet , reducing efficiency .
For a given material and bullet , the strike velocity is the primary factor determining which outcome is achieved .

Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , Tikal reached its apogee during the Classic Period , ca .
Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at Tikal and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned .
The reliance on seasonal rainfall left Tikal vulnerable to prolonged drought , which is thought by some to have played a role in the Classic Maya Collapse .
During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico .
One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities , Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in ten reservoirs .
Tikal prospered with intensive agricultural techniques , which were far more advanced than the slash and burn methods originally theorized by archaeologists .
Archaeologists working in Tikal during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use .

Eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than those of prokaryotes .
In most eukaryotes , these protein carrying vesicles are released and further modified in stacks of flattened vesicles , called Golgi bodies or dictyosomes .
In higher plants , most of a cell 's volume is taken up by a central vacuole , which primarily maintains its osmotic pressure .
It includes the rough ER where ribosomes are attached to synthesize proteins , which enter the interior space or lumen .
In multicellular organisms , hormones are often produced in vesicles .
Eukaryotic cells include a variety of membrane bound structures , collectively referred to as the endomembrane system .
Many cells ingest food and other materials through a process of endocytosis , where the outer membrane invaginates and then pinches off to form a vesicle .
Simple compartments , called vesicles or vacuoles , can form by budding off other membranes .

The young are usually born in litters of three to seven , after a gestation period of 23 days .
This article includes information translated from the German and French Wikipedias .
Garden dormice are often found in the Alps , in the Bavarian Forest , and in the Ore Mountains .
At night they look for food , mainly eating larger insects like grasshoppers and beetles , snails , eggs , young nestlings , small mice , and spiders , as well as berries , fruit , and nuts like acorns and beechnuts .
The mating period lasts from April to June .
Garden dormice are primarily nocturnal , sleeping in spherical nests in trees during the day .
Cannibalism is also observed occasionally when the animal is coming out of hibernation .
It is not unusual for a garden dormouse to eat one of its unfortunate rivals during the mating season .
They suggested this is a result of the landscape becoming increasingly monotonous and due to climate change , which they said interrupts hibernation .
In spite of its name , the garden dormouse 's main habitat is the forest , though it can also be found in fruit growing regions .
It is particularly common in southern Europe , but its range extends into the north .
While omnivorous , the diet of dormice contains slightly more animal protein than vegetation .
The garden dormouse can be recognized by black eye markings , relatively large ears , short hair , and a white tassel at the end of the tail .

The federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the Constitution .
The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in various other Australian state capitals , most frequently Sydney and Melbourne .
The theoretical possibility of the British Parliament enacting laws to override the Australian Constitution was also removed .
Section 2 of the Australian Constitution provides that a Governor General shall represent the Queen in Australia .
This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government .
Further , each State has its own constitution , so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments , none of which can encroach on the functions of any other .
The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical , and in 1956 Robert Menzies created a two tier ministry , with only senior ministers holding Cabinet rank , also known within parliament as the front bench .
The Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Sydney are located in Phillip Street .

The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self governing British colonies , which became the six states .
The Governor General represents Australia internationally , making and receiving State visits .
The members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single member constituencies allocated among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population .
In practice , the Governor General carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state , without reference to the Queen .
These are rarely exercised , but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister .
Prior to the 2007 general election , the then Leader of the Opposition , Kevin Rudd , said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become Prime Minister .
The Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor General , the Prime Minister and Ministers .
There are times when the government acts in a `` caretaker '' capacity , principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election .
The legislatures of these territories exercise powers delegated to them by the Commonwealth , and the Commonwealth Parliament retains the power to override territorial legislation and to transfer powers to or from the territories .
That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice President of the Executive Council .
All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council , a body which is chaired by the Governor General and which meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet .
The terms of this agreement are embodied in the Australian Constitution , which was drawn up at a Constitutional Convention and ratified by the people of the colonies at referendums .
This may be achieved by way of an amendment to the Constitution via referendum ( a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the States to the Commonwealth , or vice versa , should be implemented ) .
The Australian Parliament is bicameral , consisting of the Queen , a 76 member Senate and a 150 member House of Representatives .
General elections are held at least once every three years .
The question of whether the Queen is Australia 's head of state became a political one during the 1999 Australian republic referendum , when opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claimed that Australia already had an Australian as head of state in the person of the Governor General , who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen .
Though in many respects the Governor General is the Queen 's representative , and exercises various constitutional powers in her name , they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution .
Under the prevailing Westminster system , the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is invited to form a government and is named Prime Minister .
The Australian Republican Movement continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in Australia , opposed by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy .
In 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the Governor General as the Australian head of state , announcing an overseas visit by Quentin Bryce by saying , `` A visit to Africa of this scale by Australia 's Head of State will express the seriousness of Australia 's commitment '' .
The former Governor General , Major General Michael Jeffery , said in 2004 : `` Her Majesty is Australia 's head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role . ''
In practice , the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people , the Queen of Australia and the Governor General of Australia , who is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia .
The day to day business of the house is usually negotiated between a designated senior Minister , who holds the title Leader of the House , and an Opposition frontbencher known as the Manager of Opposition Business .
Although the government , by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature , can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house , the Opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses .
Under the conventions of the Westminster system the Governor General 's powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers .
Instead , these territories are largely governed by federal law , with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands also having local governments .
Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting , however , their term of office is not fixed : it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends the day before the next such election day .
The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament , of which they must , in most circumstances , be members .
Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six year terms , using proportional representation and the single transferable vote ( known in Australia as `` preferential voting '' : see Australian electoral system ) , with half elected every three years .
However , in 2005 , he declined to name the Queen as head of state , instead saying in response to a direct question , `` The Queen is the Monarch and I represent her , and I carry out all the functions of head of state . ''
These bodies such as Councils are composed of elected representatives ( known as either councilor or alderman depending on the State ) , usually serving on a part time basis .
In ordinary legislation , the two chambers have coordinate powers , but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the House of Representatives .
This was intended to allow the Senators of the smaller States to form a majority and amend or even reject bills originating in the House of Representatives .
It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet , and to carry out various other functions .
Kevin Rudd has said that he is in favor of the Cabinet meeting in other places , such as major regional cities .
Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet .
The ACT and the NT also elect two senators each .
The Governor General usually presides at Council meetings , but a Minister with the title Vice President of the Executive Council serves as the link between the government and the Council .
The Commonwealth Constitution also provides that the States can agree to refer any of their powers to the Commonwealth .
In 1907 , however , the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party , the Caucus , and the Prime Minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios .
While Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are represented in the Commonwealth Parliament , Norfolk Islanders are not represented federally .
In addition , Australia has several territories , three of which are self governing : the Australian Capital Territory ( ACT ) , the Northern Territory ( NT ) and Norfolk Island .
The Prime Minister has a discretion to advise the Governor General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time , but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the Constitution .
The proposal would have removed references to the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister , but subject to the approval of a two thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament .
The most recent general election was on 21 August 2010 .
All remaining responsibilities are retained by the six States ( previously separate colonies ) .
The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which reflects the differing populations of the States .
In a 1999 referendum , the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution .
Until the passage of the Australia Act 1986 , and associated legislation in the parliament of the United Kingdom , some Australian cases could be referred to the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal .
Section 1 of the Australian Constitution creates a democratic legislature , the bicameral Parliament of Australia which consists of the Queen and two houses , the Senate and the House of Representatives .
But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States : all States elect 12 Senators , regardless of population .
To become effective , the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age , and must receive a `` double majority '' : a majority of all votes , and a majority of votes in a majority of States .
The Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the Westminster system , with a recognized Leader of the Opposition , usually the leader of the largest party outside the government , and a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who `` shadow '' each member of the Ministry , asking questions on matters within the Minister 's portfolio .
The Australian Constitution dates from 1901 , when the Dominions of the British Empire were not sovereign states , and does not use the term `` head of state '' .
Australia 's other territories that are regularly inhabited ( Jervis Bay , Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) are not self governing .
In addition to the state Senators , two senators are elected by voters from the Northern Territory ( which for this purpose includes the Indian Ocean Territories , Christmas Island and the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands ) , while another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory ( which includes the Jervis Bay Territory for this purpose ) .
When the Labor first held office under Chris Watson , Watson assumed the right to choose members of his Cabinet .

These large sketches , with their free and vigorous brushwork , were revolutionary at the time , and they continue to interest artists , scholars and the general public .
He told Leslie , `` When I sit down to make a sketch from nature , the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture '' .
Although Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the `` finished '' picture market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions , constant refreshment in the form of on the spot studies was essential to his working method , and he never satisfied himself with following a formula .
Constable quietly rebelled against the artistic culture that taught artists to use their imagination to compose their pictures rather than nature itself .
The sketches themselves were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air .
To convey the effects of light and movement , Constable used broken brushstrokes , often in small touches , which he scumbled over lighter passages , creating an impression of sparkling light enveloping the entire landscape .
John Constable ( 11 June 1776 â `` 31 March 1837 ) was an English Romantic painter .
`` I have done a good deal of skying '' , Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821 ; `` I am determined to conquer all difficulties , and that most arduous one among the rest '' .
When he exhibited it in 1836 , Constable appended a text to the title : `` The mysterious monument of Stonehenge , standing remote on a bare and boundless heath , as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present , carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period . ''
Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable 's work , the oil sketches reveal him in retrospect to have been an avant garde painter , one who demonstrated that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction .
`` The world is wide '' , he wrote , `` no two days are alike , nor even two hours ; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world ; and the genuine productions of art , like those of nature , are all distinct from each other . ''
Constable painted many full scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes in order to test the composition in advance of finished pictures .
In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of clouds ; Constable 's annotations of his own copy of Researches About Atmospheric Phaenomena by Thomas Forster show him to have been fully abreast of meteorological terminology .
Constable once wrote in a letter to Leslie , `` My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge , and in every lane , and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up '' .
In addition to the full scale oil sketches , Constable completed numerous observational studies of landscapes and clouds , determined to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions .
One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is Seascape Study with Rain Cloud , painted in around 1824 at Brighton , which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes the immediacy of an exploding cumulus shower at sea .
The oil sketches of The Leaping Horse and The Hay Wain , for example , convey a vigor and expressiveness missing from Constable 's finished paintings of the same subjects .
Constable 's watercolors were also remarkably free for their time : the almost mystical Stonehenge , 1835 , with its double rainbow , is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolors ever painted .
He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be .
Constable 's art inspired not only contemporaries like GÃ ricault and Delacroix , but the Barbizon School , and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century .
The power of his physical effects was sometimes apparent even in the full scale paintings which he exhibited in London ; The Chain Pier , 1827 , for example , prompted a critic to write : `` the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it , that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella '' .
To the sky studies he added notes , often on the back of the sketches , of the prevailing weather conditions , direction of light , and time of day , believing that the sky was `` the key note , the standard of scale , and the chief organ of sentiment '' in a landscape painting .
Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects , for example in Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows , 1831 , and in Cottage at East Bergholt , 1833 .

However , the three sequels , Tim Burton 's Batman Returns and director Joel Schumacher 's Batman Forever and Batman & Robin , did not perform as well at the box office .
There was a slow decline in their numbers between about 1800 and 1870 , followed by a catastrophic decline between 1870 and 1890 .
Others argue that the species had not been common in the Pre Columbian period , but their numbers grew when devastation of the American Indian population by European diseases led to reduced competition for food .
At the time , Passenger Pigeons had one of the largest groups or flocks of any animal , second only to the Rocky Mountain locust .
The extinction of the Passenger Pigeon has two major causes .
Some estimate that there were 3 billion to 5 billion Passenger Pigeons in the United States when Europeans arrived in North America .
The term passenger pigeon in English derives from the French word passager , meaning to pass by .
Some reduction in numbers occurred because of habitat loss when the Europeans started settling further inland .
In the 18th century , the Passenger Pigeon in Europe was known to the French as tourtre ; but , in New France , the North American bird was called tourte .
The species went from being one of the most abundant birds in the world during the 19th century to extinction early in the 20th century .
Martha , thought to be the world 's last Passenger Pigeon , died on September 1 , 1914 , at the Cincinnati Zoo .
The Passenger Pigeon or Wild Pigeon ( Ectopistes migratorius ) is an extinct bird , which existed in North America and lived in enormous migratory flocks .
The primary factor emerged when pigeon meat was commercialized as a cheap food for slaves and the poor in the 19th century , resulting in hunting on a massive scale .
In modern French , the bird is known as the pigeon migrateur .
In Algonquian languages , it was called amimi by the Lenape and omiimii by the Ojibwe .

Baldwin began work with his older sons on the Middlesex Canal in 1794 and after nine years , the canal began service in 1803 .
Baldwin was elected to various public offices between 1780 and 1796 .
Colonel Loammi Baldwin ( January 10 , 1744 October 20 , 1807 ) was a noted American engineer , politician , and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War .
His son Benjamin worked on the Boston Mill Dam for before an early death at age 43 .

Baldwin is known as the Father of American Civil Engineering .
In 1774 Baldwin enlisted in a regiment , and commanded the Woburn militia at the Battle of Lexington and Concord as a major .

The last penal settlement in Tasmania at Port Arthur finally closed in 1877 .
There were five female factories in Van Diemen 's Land .
In 1824 , Van Diemen 's Land became a colony in its own right .
Complaints from Victorians about recently released convicts from Van Diemen 's Land re offending in Victoria was one of the contributing reasons for the eventual abolition of transportation to Van Diemen 's Land in 1853 .
From the 1830s to the 1853 abolition of penal transportation ( known simply as `` transportation '' ) , Van Diemen 's Land was the primary penal colony in Australia .
Following the suspension of transportation to New South Wales , all transported convicts were sent to Van Diemen 's Land .
Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria , to the disgust of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne .
Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket of leave often promptly left Van Diemen 's Land .
Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory ( women 's workhouse prison ) .
Landing at Blackman 's Bay and later having the Dutch flag flown at North Bay , Tasman named the island Anthoonij van Diemenslandt in honor of Anthony van Diemen , the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies who had sent Tasman on his voyage of discovery in 1642 .

In 1803 , the island was colonised by the British as a penal colony with the name Van Diemen 's Land , and became part of the British colony of New South Wales .
The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman was the first European to land on the shores of Tasmania .
Only the most difficult convicts ( mostly re offenders ) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur .

The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews , however , the compromise in features was criticized .
MacBook Air 's launch was accompanied by a television commercial emphasizing its slender design .
To reduce the computer 's size and weight , several features were sacrificed .
To regain the features of an optical drive , users can either use a separately available external USB SuperDrive , or the bundled Remote Disc software to access the optical drive of another computer .
Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results : the deactivation of 1 CPU core appears to have been corrected ; however , the runaway kernel problem remains for at least some users .
Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air , such as the reduction of toxic chemicals like lead , to make it more `` environmentally friendly '' .
The full sized keyboard , weight , thinness , and Multi Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews , while the limited configuration options , slow speed ( in the non SSD models ) , non user replaceable battery , small hard drive , and price were criticized .
The computer features a glossy LED backlit display and a full size keyboard , as well as a large trackpad that responds to iPad related Multi Touch gestures such as pinching , swiping , and rotating .
The Remote Disc capability is achieved by the computer wirelessly accessing the optical drive of another Mac or Windows PC that has the Remote Disc program installed .
However , for the 2009 revision , the adapter is included in the box .
It also omits a FireWire port , Ethernet port , line in , media card slots ( except the 13 '' 2010 model , which has an SD card slot ) , and a Kensington Security Slot .

The problem is aggravated by system intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting .
The music playing is `` New Soul '' by Yael NaÃ m.
For these features , an external USB drive is required .
Additionally , in the 2008 revision , the hard drive , graphics , front side bus , processor , memory , battery , and port connections were upgraded .
Remote Disc supports netbooting , so the MacBook Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer 's drive .
This feature requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on the remote computer .
ArsTechnica found `` moderate '' performance improvements of the 64 GB solid state drive of the first generation Air over the standard 80 GB hard drive in tests .
Apple has removed the flip down hatch on the late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports as on most other laptops .
Ackerman disliked the limited internet connectivity , slow speed , small hard drive , battery , and the price of SSD hard drive option , however , appreciated the thinness , sturdiness , and the MultiTouch gestures .
The effect can be seen at CPU temperatures as low as 150 Â and worsens with higher temperatures .
In the commercial , a hand unthreads a manila envelope and slides out a MacBook Air , then opens it to wake it from sleep .
On October 14 , 2008 , new models were announced with improved capacities of 128 GB ( solid state ) and 120 GB ( hard drive ) .
The software does not allow the playback or information of DVDs or CDs , nor does it allow the installation of Microsoft Windows .
The MacBook Air includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard pre installed , along with Apple 's iLife multimedia suite .
With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard , the Air 's multi touch trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters .
It was also Apple 's first computer with an optional solid state storage drive .
Since the release of the first generation product , some MacBook Air users have complained of overheating that caused CPU lockup .
It was Apple 's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built in removable media drive .
It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD .
The MacBook Air was greeted with mixed reception when it was introduced .
The MacBook Air was the first subcompact laptop offered by Apple since the full featured 12 '' PowerBook G4 was discontinued in 2006 .
However , this method only allows for disk browsing or software installation ; DVD movies or CDs can not be watched or listened to .

A few species reach weights approaching 1 k. Within any species , the males are larger than the females and can be nearly double their weight .
Although they will attempt to flee when threatened , they may attack other animals , including cats and humans , and can inflict serious bites with their long , sharp teeth .
All pocket gophers are burrowers .
There has been much debate among taxonomists about which races of pocket gopher should be recognized as full species , and the following list can not be regarded as definitive .
These pouches are fur lined , and can be turned inside out .
Most gophers have brown fur that often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live .
They have small eyes and a short , hairy tail , which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards .
Some sources also list a genus Hypogeomys , with one species , but this genus name is normally used for the Malagasy Giant Rat , which belongs to the family Nesomyidae .
The pocket gophers are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae .
For this reason , some species are considered agricultural pests .

During the Manhattan Project , the joint effort during World War II by the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada to create the first nuclear weapons , there were many instances of nuclear espionage in which project scientists or technicians channeled information about bomb development and design to the Soviet Union .
Because most of these cases became well known in the context of the anti Communist 1950s , there has been long standing dispute over the exact details of these cases , though some of this was settled with the making public of the VENONA Project transcripts , which were intercepted and decrypted messages between Soviet agents and the Soviet government .
The investigations described in the report eventually led to the arrest of Wen Ho Lee , a scientist at Los Alamos , initially accused of giving weapons information to the PRC .
Pakistan 's government claims they had no part in the espionage , but refuses to turn Khan over for questioning by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Whether the espionage information significantly aided the speed of the Soviet atomic bomb project is also disputed . While some of the information given , such as the highly technical theoretical information given by Klaus Fuchs , would be thought to have certainly aided in developing a nuclear weapon , the manner in which the heads of the Soviet bomb project , Igor Kurchatov and Lavrenty Beria , actually used the information has led later scholars to doubt it having had a role in increasing the speed of development .
On February 5 , 2004 , the president of Pakistan , General Pervez Musharraf , announced that he had pardoned Khan .
These people are often referred to as the Atomic Spies , and their work continued into the early Cold War .
Some issues remain unsettled , however .
According to the report , the PRC had `` stolen classified information on all of the United States ' most advanced thermonuclear warheads '' since the 1970s , including the design of advanced miniaturized thermonuclear warheads ( which can be used on MIRV weapons ) , the neutron bomb , and `` weapons codes '' which allow for computer simulations of nuclear testing ( and allow the PRC to advance their weapon development without testing themselves ) .
No other arrests regarding the theft of the nuclear designs have been made .
States are also limited in their making public of weapons information by non proliferation agreements .
The United States was apparently unaware of this until 1995 .
Whether Vanunu was truly involved in espionage , per se , is debated : Vanunu and his supporters claim that he should be regarded as a whistle blower ( someone who was exposing a secretive and illegal practice ) , while his opponents see him as a traitor and his divulgence of information as aiding enemies of the Israeli state .
Khan had previously been indicated as having taken gas centrifuge designs from a uranium enrichment company in the Netherlands ( URENCO ) which he used to jump start Pakistan 's own nuclear weapons program .
Nuclear espionage is the purposeful giving of state secrets regarding nuclear weapons to other states without authorization ( espionage ) .
The case against Lee eventually fell apart , however , and he was eventually charged only with mishandling of data .
During the history of nuclear weapons there have been many cases of known nuclear espionage , and also many cases of suspected or alleged espionage .
Israel has never acknowledged or denied having a weapons program , and Vanunu was abducted and smuggled to Israel , where he was tried in camera and convicted of treason and espionage .
In January 2004 , Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan , a Pakistani nuclear scientist , confessed to selling restricted nuclear weapons technology to Libya , Iran , and North Korea .
Vanunu did not immediately release his information and photos on leaving Israel , traveling for about a year before doing so .
In 1986 , a former technician , Mordechai Vanunu , at the Israeli nuclear facility near Dimona revealed information about the Israeli nuclear weapon program to the British press , confirming widely held notions that Israel had an advanced and secretive nuclear weapons program and stockpile .
Because nuclear weapons are generally considered the most important of state secrets , all nations with nuclear weapons have strict restrictions against the giving of information relating to nuclear weapon design , stockpiles , delivery systems , and deployment .
According to his testimony and reports from intelligence agencies , Khan sold designs for gas centrifuges ( used for uranium enrichment ) , Chinese designs for a nuclear warhead , and sold centrifuges themselves to these three countries .
Other people and groups arrested or fined were scientist Peter Lee ( no relation ) , who was arrested for allegedly giving submarine radar secrets to China , and Loral Space & Communications and Hughes Electronics who gave China missile secrets .

One literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery , `` it would be just another sentimental novel , '' while another described the book as `` primarily a derivative piece of hack work . ''
Charles Francis Adams , the American minister to Britain during the war , argued later that `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin ; or Life among the Lowly , published in 1852 , exercised , largely from fortuitous circumstances , a more immediate , considerable and dramatic world influence than any other book ever printed . ''
Tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed , writing that sentimental novels showed how women 's emotions had the power to change the world for the better .
Stowe 's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson 's : God 's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them .
Uncle Tom 's Cabin has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history .
When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone , Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom .

The book opens with a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing the loss of his farm because of debts .
She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century , including Uncle Tom 's Cabin , were remarkable for their `` intellectual complexity , ambition , and resourcefulness '' ; and that Uncle Tom 's Cabin offers a `` critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville . ''
For Stowe , blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families .
Other critics , though , have praised the novel .
Since then , many writers have credited this novel with focusing Northern anger at the injustices of slavery and the Fugitive Slave Law and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement .
Union general and politician James Baird Weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement .
However , later research indicated that Stowe did not actually read many of the book 's cited works until after the publication of her novel .

Stowe 's puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel 's final , over arching theme the exploration of the nature of Christianity and how she feels Christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery .
For example , as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist , Stowe placed many of her religion 's beliefs into the novel .

In the book , Stowe discusses each of the major characters in Uncle Tom 's Cabin and cites `` real life equivalents '' to them while also mounting a more `` aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had . ''
These negative associations have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of Uncle Tom 's Cabin as a `` vital antislavery tool . ''
These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe 's time and tended to feature female main characters and a writing style which evoked a reader 's sympathy and emotion .
Loker has changed as the result of being healed by the Quakers .
Legree beats Tom viciously , and resolves to crush his new slave 's faith in God .
In The Literary History of the United States , George F. Whicher called Uncle Tom 's Cabin `` Sunday school fiction '' , full of `` broadly conceived melodrama , humor , and pathos . ''
Despite these criticisms , the novel still captured the imagination of many Americans .
The first London edition appeared in May 1852 , and sold 200,000 copies .
As the first widely read political novel in the United States , Uncle Tom 's Cabin greatly influenced development of not only American literature but also protest literature in general .

Many Southern writers , like Simms , soon wrote their own books in opposition to Stowe 's novel ( see the Anti Tom section below ) .
Eventually Loker and his men trap Eliza and her family , causing George to shoot Loker .
One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how this `` peculiar institution '' forcibly separated families from each other .
It should be noted , though , that while Stowe claimed A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin documented her previously consulted sources , she actually read many of the cited works only after the publication of her novel .
The novel has also been dismissed by a number of literary critics as `` merely a sentimental novel , '' while critic George Whicher stated in his Literary History of the United States that `` Nothing attributable to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel 's enormous vogue ; its author 's resources as a purveyor of Sunday school fiction were not remarkable .
In order to change the notion of manhood so that men could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self image or their standing in society , some abolitionists drew on principles of women 's suffrage and Christianity as well as passivism , and praised men for cooperation , compassion , and civic spirit .
According to Rankin , in February , 1838 a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her way further north .
As one prominent writer explained , `` The evil passions which ` Uncle Tom ' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance ( of slavery ) , but national jealousy and national vanity .
Before St. Clare can follow through on his pledge , however , he dies after being stabbed while entering a New Orleans tavern .
Feminist theory can also be seen at play in Stowe 's book , with the novel as a critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery .
Even though Stowe 's novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on a large theme like slavery and by having a man as the main character , she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her readers ( such as making them cry at the death of Little Eva ) .
Uncle Tom 's Cabin also created great interest in England .

However , they are now being tracked by a slave hunter named Tom Loker .
Eva begs her father to buy Tom , and he becomes the head coachman at the St. Clare plantation . He spends most of his time with the angelic Eva , however .
Because Stowe saw motherhood as the `` ethical and structural model for all of American life , '' and also believed that only women had the moral authority to save the United States from the demon of slavery , another major theme of Uncle Tom 's Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women .
Legree ( a transplanted northerner ) takes Tom to rural Louisiana , where Tom meets Legree 's other slaves , including Emmeline ( whom Legree purchased at the same time ) .
However , in 1985 Jane Tompkins expressed a different view of Uncle Tom 's Cabin with her book In Sensational Designs : The Cultural Work of American Fiction .
It is reported that `` She observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write ( the ) famous anti slavery novel .
Modern scholars and readers have criticized the book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book 's black characters , especially with regard to the characters ' appearances , speech , and behavior , as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate .
Historians are undecided if Lincoln actually said this line , and in a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln no mention of this comment was made .
This theme is most evident when Tom urges St. Clare to `` look away to Jesus '' after the death of St. Clare 's beloved daughter Eva .
According to Stowe 's son , when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln commented , `` So this is the little lady who started this great war . ''
While at the plantation , Tom meets Cassy , another of Legree 's slaves .
In this view , the character of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor , while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery .
Immediately upon publication , Uncle Tom 's Cabin outraged people in the American South .
Eva , whose real name is Evangeline St. Clare , is the daughter of Augustine St. Clare .
The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom 's Cabin .
Back in New Orleans , St. Clare debates slavery with his Northern cousin Ophelia who , while opposing slavery , is prejudiced against black people .
When Eva falls into the river , Tom saves her . In gratitude , Eva 's father , Augustine St. Clare , buys Tom from the slave trader and takes him with the family to their home in New Orleans .
Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time .
The novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters .
Like the novel , A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin was also a best seller .
Another reader is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter Eva .
As a best seller , the novel heavily influenced later protest literature .
Acclaimed Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms declared the work utterly false , while others called the novel criminal and slanderous .
Stowe mentioned a number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin ( 1853 ) .
The book has been translated into almost every language , including Chinese ( with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel ) and Amharic ( with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation ) .
Which of Stowe 's characters should be emulated , the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris ?
Uncle Tom 's Cabin ; or , Life Among the Lowly is an anti slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe .
The character Eliza was inspired by an account given at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe 's husband Calvin , a professor at the school .
She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama , humor , and pathos , and of these popular cements she compounded her book . ''
Uncle Tom 's Cabin is written in the sentimental and melodramatic style common to 19th century sentimental novels and domestic fiction ( also called women 's fiction ) .
Cassy was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold ; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold , she killed her third child .

This National Natural Landmark stretches for about sixty miles southwest from Grand Coulee Dam to Soap Lake , being bisected by Dry Falls into the Upper and Lower Grand Coulee .
The Grand Coulee is an ancient river bed in the U.S. state of Washington .
The Upper Grand Coulee was dammed and turned into Banks Lake .
The Lower Grand Coulee contains Park , Blue , Alkali , Lenore , and Soap lakes .
Until recently , the Upper Coulee was dry .
The area surrounding the Grand Coulee is shrub steppe habitat , with an average annual rainfall of less than twelve inches .
The Columbia Basin Project changed this in 1952 , using the ancient river bed as an irrigation distribution network .
The lake is filled by pumps from the Grand Coulee Dam and forms the first leg of a hundred mile ( 160 km ) irrigation system .
In principle , the only remaining problem was to be sure ( or at least confident ) that a public key actually belonged to its supposed owner .
In particular , it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically , as , for instance , in electronic commerce .
If Alice and Bob wish to exchange encrypted messages , each must be equipped to encrypt messages to be sent and decrypt messages received .
Public key infrastructures have been proposed as a way around this problem of identity authentication .
Each user is responsible for vetting any certificate from another before using that certificate to communicate with , vet digital signatures from , ... the user claimed to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate .
If they use a code , both will require a copy of the same codebook .
Some of the existing work around designs work , more or less , but are not fully satisfactory .
The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information are needed so that no one else can obtain a copy .
The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved .
With the advent of public key \/ private key cipher algorithms , the encrypting key ( aka public key ) could be made public , since ( at least for high quality algorithms ) no one without the decrypting key ( aka , the private key ) could decrypt the message .
The nature of the equipping they require depends on the encryption technique they might use .
In their most usual implementation , each user applies to a ` certificate authority ' for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a non tamperable authentication of identity .
If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher , both will need a copy of the same key .
Traditionally , this required trusted couriers , diplomatic bags , or some other secure channel .
If they use a cipher , they will need appropriate keys .
The production was released on audio cassette by Hodder Headline Audiobooks by arrangement with BBC Enterprises ( ISBN 1 85998 218 2 ) .
The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall .
In 1963 , Erik Chisholm composed an opera from the play , using Wilde 's text as the libretto .
After imprisonment , he published the play from Paris but wrote no further comic or dramatic work .
The production was released on audio cassette by the BBC Radio Collection ( ISBN 0 563 47803 9 ) .
The Marquess of Queensberry , father of Lord Alfred Douglas , an intimate friend of Wilde , planned to present Wilde a bouquet of spoiling vegetables and disrupt the show .
George Bernard Shaw , for example , reviewed the play in the Saturday Review , arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse , `` I go to the theater to be moved to laughter '' .
Soon afterwards the feud came to a climax in court , and Wilde 's new notoriety caused the play , despite its success , to be closed after just 86 performances .
The Importance of being Earnest , A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde .
In contrast to much theater of the time , The Importance of Being Earnests light plot does not tackle serious social and political issues , something contemporary reviewers were wary of .
The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere , and adapted for the cinema on three occasions : in The Importance of Being Earnest ( 1952 ) , Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell ; The Importance of Being Earnest ( 1992 ) by Kurt Baker used an all black cast ; and Oliver Parker 's The Importance of Being Earnest ( 2002 ) included material cut during the original stage production .
To commemorate the centenary of the first performance of The Importance of Being Earnest , BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation on 13 February 1995 ; directed by Glyn Dearman , it featured Dame Judi Dench as `` Lady Bracknell '' , Sir Michael Hordern as `` Lane '' , Michael Sheen as `` Jack Worthing '' , Martin Clunes as `` Algernon Moncrieff '' , John Moffatt as `` Rev. Canon Chasuble '' , Miriam Margolyes as `` Miss Prism '' , Samantha Bond as `` Gwendolen '' and Amanda Root as `` Cecily '' .
On 13 December 2000 , BBC Radio 3 broadcast a new radio adaptation directed by Howard Davies starring Geraldine McEwan as `` Lady Bracknell '' , Simon Russell Beale as `` Jack Worthing '' , Julian Wadham as `` Algernon Moncrieff '' , Geoffrey Palmer as `` Rev. Canon Chasuble '' , Celia Imrie as `` Miss Prism '' , Victoria Hamilton as `` Gwendolen '' and Emma Fielding as `` Cecily '' , with music composed by Dominic Muldowney .
Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission .

A large number of plants can be either shrubs or trees , depending on the growing conditions they experience .
In botany and ecology a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular physical structural or plant life form of woody plants which are less than 8 m high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base .
For example , a descriptive system widely adopted in Australia is based on structural characteristics based on life form , plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or dominant species .
Small , low shrubs such as lavender , periwinkle and thyme are often termed subshrubs .

In 1849 , James B. Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90 % efficiency .
Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner , creating a force on the blades .
The jet pushes on the turbine 's curved blades which changes the direction of the flow .
In the United States , it is now illegal to block the migration of fish , for example the endangered great white sturgeon in North America , so fish ladders must be provided by dam builders .
Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine .
It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low head hydro sites .
The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years .
Water turbines are divided into two groups ; reaction turbines and impulse turbines .
Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields , Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet , which had converted a high head ( hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock ) of water to kinetic energy .
It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today .
In 1844 , Uriah A. Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine .
They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades .
In 1879 , Lester Pelton ( 1829 1908 ) , experimenting with a Knight Wheel , developed a double bucket design , which exhausted the water to the side , eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel .
The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor .
Small turbines ( mostly under 10 MW ) may have horizontal shafts , and even fairly large bulb type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal .
The stationary outlet also had curved guides .
Some people believe that it is possible to construct hydropower systems that divert fish and other organisms away from turbine intakes without significant damage or loss of power ; historical performance of diversion structures have been poor .
They could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads .
Since the runner is spinning , the force acts through a distance ( force acting through a distance is the definition of work ) .
Dams alter the natural ecology of rivers , potentially killing fish , stopping migrations , and disrupting peoples ' livelihoods .
Turgo and Crossflow turbines were later impulse designs .
They produce significant amounts of the world 's electrical supply .
Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements ; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years .
Now they are mostly used for electric power generation .
Some water turbines are designed for pumped storage hydroelectricity .
For example , American Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest had livelihoods built around salmon fishing , but aggressive dam building destroyed their way of life .
In 1820 , Jean Victor Poncelet developed an inward flow turbine .
Newton 's third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines .
Impulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet .
Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design .
Damaged areas are cut or ground out , then welded back up to their original or an improved profile .
It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites .
Other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings , packing box and shaft sleeves , servomotors , cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils , seal rings , wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces .
Turbine selection is based mostly on the available water head , and less so on the available flow rate .
Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs .
Large modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90 % ( not to be confused with thermodynamic efficiency ) .
Development occurred during the Industrial revolution , using scientific principles and methods .
The water 's velocity , roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery , does a u turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity .
They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time .
This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92 % efficiency .
( Later , impulse turbines were developed which did n't use swirl ) .
This was an efficient machine ( ~ 80 % ) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension .
Steel elements are repaired by welding , usually with stainless steel rods .
Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime .
In this way , energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine
He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design .
This is called an impulse or tangential turbine .
Water wheels have been used for thousands of years for industrial power .
Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions , since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions .
Normal wear and tear includes pitting from cavitation , fatigue cracking , and abrasion from suspended solids in the water .
This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power .
It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines .
A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer .
In 1826 , Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward flow turbine .
A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water .
Since the turbine is spinning , the force acts through a distance ( work ) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy .
The Francis turbine , named for him , is the first modern water turbine .
No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades , and the turbine does n't require a housing for operation .
In general , impulse turbines are used for high head sites , and reaction turbines are used for low head sites .
They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off peak electrical hours , and then revert to a turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand .
In about 1895 , William Doble improved on Pelton 's half cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry .
JÃ n Andrej Segner developed a reactive water turbine in the mid 18th century .
Around 1913 , Viktor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine , a propeller type machine .
Reaction turbines are acted on by water , which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy .
They must be encased to contain the water pressure ( or suction ) , or they must be fully submerged in the water flow .
Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head , and makes installation of a generator more economical .
Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design .
The word turbine was introduced by the French engineer Claude Bourdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for `` whirling '' or a `` vortex '' .
Their main shortcoming is size , which limits the flow rate and head that can be harnessed .
Some impulse turbines use multiple water jets per runner to increase specific speed and balance shaft thrust .
Around 1890 , the modern fluid bearing was invented , now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles .
This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis in design .
All common water machines until the late 19th century ( including water wheels ) were basically reaction machines ; water pressure head acted on the machine and produced work .
Prior to hitting the turbine blades , the water 's pressure ( potential energy ) is converted to kinetic energy by a nozzle and focused on the turbine .
Historically there have also been negative consequences , mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production .
Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal , inspection , and repair of worn parts .
Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head .
The resulting change in momentum ( impulse ) causes a force on the turbine blades .
In 1866 , California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that took the impulse system to a new level .
Water pressure decreases to atmospheric , or in some cases subatmospheric , as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy .
Water turbines were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids .
They harness a clean and renewable energy source .
In other words , it is the maximum energy per unit volume that can be elastically stored .
Resilience is the property of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then , upon unloading to have this energy recovered .
An example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage , the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip .
Modulus of resilience , , can be calculated using the following formula : , where is yield stress , is Young 's modulus , and is the strain at the yield stress .
It is represented by the area ( integral ) under the curve in the elastic region ( the initial , linear portion ) of the stress strain curve ; this quantity is also known as the elastic potential energy of a material .

In this system , the western edge of one plate , the Pacific Plate , is subducted beneath the smaller Mariana Plate that lies to the west .
The Mariana Trench is the deepest part of the world 's oceans , and the lowest elevation of the surface of the Earth 's crust .
The movement of these plates is also responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands .
Because the Pacific plate is the largest of all the tectonic plates on Earth , crustal material at its western edge has had a long time since formation ( up to 170 million years ) to compact and become very dense ; hence its great height difference relative to the higher riding Mariana Plate , at the point where the Pacific Plate crust is subducted .
This deep area is the Mariana Trench proper .

Arbace comes with news that the people , led by the High Priest of Neptune , are clamoring for Idomeneo .
Idomeneo is not lost at sea , but instead is saved by Neptune ( god of the sea ) and is washed up on a Cretan beach .
The High Priest tells the king of the destruction caused by Neptune 's monster , urging Idomeneo to reveal the name of the person whose sacrifice is demanded by the god .
Outside the temple , the king and High Priest join with Neptune 's priests in prayer that the god may be appeased .

Bukit Timah is located near the center of the Singapore main island .
Today , these have been replaced with luxury bungalows , terraces and condominiums , making Bukit Timah Singapore 's premier residential district .
Some of the Japanese war dead were taken back to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , while the remains of the British troops were interred at the British Commonwealth 's Kranji War Memorial in Singapore .
For example , the Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Dunearn Road is being redeveloped into condominiums for sale .
The hill was depicted on the map towards the northwest as two hills at the eastern source of the Kranji River .
Two war memorials dedicated to the Japanese war dead and , surprisingly , to the British and Empire troops who died defending Singapore , were built at the site .
The site of the Syonan Jinja lies in a gray area between the Nature Reserve and Singapore Armed Forces restricted area .
The hill was viewed then as an `` excellent sanatorium '' , as the air was `` cooler and fresher than the plain , producing an agreeable exhilaration of spirits '' .
The Wayang Satu and Bukit Timah village parts are differently called .
Several historians have been to the site , and an episode from then Television Corporation of Singapore ( TCS ) history documentary program , `` Hey Singapore '' , was based on Syonan Jinja .
The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore , and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve , which is partially responsible for its high land value .
This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah ( District 21 ) was formed .
During the Japanese Occupation , Japanese troops built Syonan Jinja , a Shinto shrine ( Syonan to was the Occupation name for Singapore ) , similar to the Yasukuni Shrine in Japan but of a smaller size , at Bukit Timah .
Shortly before the Japanese surrender , Japanese forces hastily destroyed Syonan Jinja , on fears that returning British forces would demolish it in an unhonourable manner .
During World War II , when the British lost Bukit Timah to the Japanese on 11 February 1942 , they knew they had little chance of continuing the defense of the island as most of their food and supplies were stored there .
The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value . The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore , and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve , which is partially responsible for its high land value .
Nothing of the Syonan Jinjashrine remains , except for the holy cleansing pond and several Japanese stone pavements left at the site .
This only refers to the lower end of the Bukit Timah Road .
In 1860 , nearly 200 people were reported to have been killed by tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations .
The first ride on horseback across the island was along Bukit Timah Road in 1840 ; it took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr Little .
The rise in land prices has led to development of new condominiums .
After the Japanese Occupation , the farms and plantations in Bukit Timah gave way to industrial buildings and high rise flats .
The Bukit Timah Race Course , a Thoroughbred horse racing facility , was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999 .
Apparently , the area was so infested with tigers that it constituted a serious threat to human life .
Bukit Timah , which literally means `` tin hill '' in Malay , was already identified on the 1828 map by Frankin and Jackson as Bukit Timah .
Students , Japanese commanders and British POWs ' representatives would gather there regularly to commemorate the dead during the Occupation .
Many expatriates and well heeled Singaporeans tend to stay in this region .
The nature reserve was established in 1883 .
The Hokkiens also refer to Bukit Timah as be chia lo bue , meaning `` end of the horse carriage road '' .
The road to Kranji was completed in 1845 .
No plans have been indicated to restore the site .
The surrounding area is an urban planning area known as Bukit Timah Planning Area under the Urban Redevelopment Authority and is part of the Central Region , and lies 10 kilometres ( 6 miles ) from the city 's central business district , the Central Area .
This course is closed to the public , unlike the former course ( now Farrer Park ) where the general public enjoyed watching the king 's sport for free .
The Keretapi Tanah Melayu from Malaysia has a passing loop station here along its rail network from Johor Bahru to Tanjong Pagar .
The 25 km long Bukit Timah Road , the longest road in Singapore , running north and south , takes its name from this hill .
In December 1843 , a carriage way road was completed leading up to the hill .
The nearby area houses many bungalows , traditionally expensive in land scarce Singapore , as well as high rise condominiums .
For some , it is synonymous with the Singapore Turf Club , where members and paying visitors flock on race days .
Bukit Timah Road is known as tek kha kang a kinn in Hokkien , which means `` the side of the stream in the tek kha ( or Selegie Road ) district '' .
Since then , the Singapore Government has designated the place as a `` Historical Site '' .
The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value .
In the 1960s and 1970s , Bukit Timah was a major industrial center .
On 15 February 1942 , the head of the Allied forces , Lieutenant General A.E. Percival surrendered to Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah .

Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of Epicurus , founded around 307 BC .
Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism , though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism .
Epicurus was an atomic materialist , following in the steps of Democritus .
He lauded the enjoyment of simple pleasures , by which he meant abstaining from bodily desires , such as sex and appetites , verging on asceticism .
Epicurus and his followers shunned politics .
After the death of Epicurus , his school was headed by Hermarchus ; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era ( such as those in Antiochia , Alexandria , Rhodes , and Ercolano ) .
Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism .
Although Epicureanism is a form of hedonism , insofar as it declares pleasure as the sole intrinsic good , its conception of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life make it different from `` hedonism '' as it is commonly understood .
He argued that when eating , one should not eat too richly , for it could lead to dissatisfaction later , such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future .
Some writings by Epicurus have survived .
Likewise , sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner .
In the Epicurean view , the highest pleasure ( tranquility and freedom from fear ) was obtained by knowledge , friendship , and living a virtuous and temperate life .
Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social morality that has survived .
The poet Lucretius is its most well known Roman proponent .
By the end of the Roman Empire , having undergone Christian attack and repression , Epicureanism had all but died out , and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi , who adapted it to the Christian doctrine .
At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus .
Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts .

Aang is a fictional character in Nickelodeon 's animated television series Avatar : The Last Airbender .
Later , in the Fire Nation capital , Aang is seen in monk robes , standing beside Zuko while he is appointed Fire Lord .
After he sleepwalks into a forest , he speaks to four previous Avatars , seeking advice .
Aang 's character has a well developed cultural ideology .
He appeared in the Avatar : The Last Airbender video game as one of the four playable characters .
He is later seen relaxing with his friends in Ba Sing Se .
Two sequels were made : Avatar : The Last Airbender â `` The Burning Earth , followed by Avatar : The Last Airbender â `` Into the Inferno .
In the Avatar State , Aang can also fly inside a sphere of air .
In the following episode , Zuko has a change of heart and offers to teach Aang firebending .
Other methods of flying include his glider , and Appa .
Aang 's character appeared in the Avatar : The Last Airbender Trading Card Game on a multitude of cards .
Aang hides the map showing their father 's whereabouts and lies about having it in the first place .
A notable aspect of the character is his vegetarian diet , consistent with Buddhism or Taoism .
The robotic Momo was changed to a flying lemur , and the herd of bison was reduced to one .
The creators intended Aang to `` defeat enemies with his wits '' and be a `` trickster hero '' .
Throughout their journey they are chased by Zuko , the banished prince of the Fire Nation , with whom they have many encounters .
Using a technique taught to him by the lion turtle , Aang removes Ozai 's ability to firebend , effectively eliminating the threat .
In some episodes , he demonstrates flight abilities with airbending .
Avatar T shirts , some with Aang appearing on them , are being sold through the Nickelodeon Shop website .
Monk Gyatso , Aang 's mentor and father figure , insists that Aang be raised as a regular child .
Reviews point out that `` as the Avatar , Aang seems unstoppable , but as Aang , he is just another Airbender '' ; the review states later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by revealing many character flaws .
In the show , Aang has a complex network of friends extending over all four nations .
In one episode , Aang meets his previous incarnation , Avatar Roku , informing him that he must master all four bending arts and defeat Fire Lord Ozai before the end of summer .
Flashbacks also reveal events that happened before the show opened .
As the Avatar , Aang has the ability to control the four classical elements and is tasked with keeping the Four Nations at peace .
Meanwhile , Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole .
In `` The Spirit World ( Winter Solstice , Part 1 ) '' , Aang gets into a fight with an angry spirit who is destroying a village ; instead of fighting the spirit , Aang negotiates .

In `` The King of Omashu '' , Aang demonstrates his vegetarian beliefs by refusing to eat meat .
The Avatar State tips the battle in Aang 's favor , and makes swift work of Ozai .
The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others .
Later , in the second season , Aang meets Toph Bei Fong , a blind earthbending master , who becomes one of his teachers .
In the show 's intended demographics , Aang has been received exceptionally well .
One technique for this is to make a whirling sphere of air and ride on it , which Aang calls the Air Scooter .
The creators lost interest in the theme , and changed it to one hundred years of suspended animation .
After sparing Ozai when redirecting his lightning and then being backed into a corner , Aang enters the Avatar State .
In `` The Firebending Masters '' Aang learns firebending with the help of the last two dragons .
During the season finale , a guru attempts to teach Aang how to open up his seven chakras in order to control the Avatar State .
This fighting style focuses on circular movements , and does not have many finishing moves .
In a flashback during `` The Storm '' , the elder monks hold a private meeting with Aang to reveal his identity as the Avatar .
According to the show 's creators , `` Buddhism and Taoism have been huge inspirations behind the idea for Avatar . ''
The show follows Aang 's journeys to complete this task , during a war instigated by the Fire Nation when he was frozen .
Due to his non violent nature , he is also depicted as showing ethical reluctance in killing Firelord Ozai , and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him .
These characteristics were meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show .
When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger , he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh chakra is opened , locking it .
The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing .
It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and plummets him into the ocean during his escape .
It is revealed in the second episode that he is the current incarnation of the Avatar , the spirit of the planet manifested in human form .
The show 's directors , Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , claim the events are canon .
Aang accepts , despite the group 's strong opposition .
In 2008 director M. Night Shyamalan cast 12 year old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series , The Last Airbender .
Nearing the end , the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much , so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple .
Aang is depicted in the series as a vegetarian , as shown in `` The King of Omashu '' and `` The Headband '' when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that all life is sacred .
Aang consistently shows a reluctance to fight and an aversion against killing .
Konietzko evolved the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison .
A couple of episodes later , Aang and his friends find out that a solar eclipse will occur before the end of the summer , rendering the Firebenders powerless .
After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion turtle , and receiving advice from said lion turtle , he prepares to confront the Fire Lord .
After 100 years in the frozen iceberg , the show opens when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the first episode of the show .
An image of this air bubble , resembling an iceberg , ends the flashback .
He also showed that he can act immaturely , and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together .
Aang then enters the Avatar State , unknowingly , for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble .
The creators of the show intended Aang to be trapped in an iceberg for one thousand years .
Airbending , the style Aang primarily uses in the show , is based on an `` internal '' Chinese martial art called Baguazhang .
The character is created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and is voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen .
The plot they described corresponds with the first and second episodes of the series , where the `` water people '' ( Katara and Sokka ) rescue the `` air guy '' ( Aang ) while `` trapped in a snowy wasteland '' ( the Southern Water Tribe ) with `` some fire people ( that ) are pressing down on them '' ( Fire Nation Troops and Zuko ) .
Once Ozai arrives , Aang engages him in battle .
He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se .
Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord , discouraging him .
Aang 's character was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko .
Tokyopop has published a films comic ( sometimes referred to as cine manga ) , in which Aang , being the main character of the show , appears repeatedly .
He was to wake inside a futuristic world , where he would have a pet robot named Momo and a dozen bison .
The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang ( as well as a primarily Caucasian cast ) in the Asian influenced Avatar universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism , a letter writing campaign , and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras .
There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a child like character who is `` reckless and excitable '' .
The series depict Aang as the last surviving Airbender and a monk of the Air Nomads , the only race of people with the unique ability to manipulate the air around them .
In the Brahmajala Sutra , a Buddhist code of ethics , vegetarianism is encouraged .
The game includes certain plot changes that are not shown in the show .
The idea caused the pair to think :
Aang reveals in `` The Storm '' that he wishes he had been there to help his people a century ago , but would rather live a child 's carefree life .
In `` Bato of the Water Tribe '' , Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father .
Aang appeared in Escape from the Spirit World , an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon 's official website .
Most of Aang 's traits , such as vegetarianism , are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition .
Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor ; he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison .
Aang is the series ' reluctant hero , showing hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation .
In the next episode , they all set off for the Northern Water Tribe , with intentions to find a Waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara .
The sketch depicted a middle aged bald man with an arrow on his head .
When the group reaches the Northern Water Tribe , a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang ( and later Katara ) waterbending .

The Earl Marshal , an hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk , oversees the College , though he is not a member of that body ; arms may not be granted without his consent .
A partial exception to this rule is the case of a woman who has no brothers , or whose brothers have no issue ; such a woman is called an heraldic heiress and may transmit the arms to her children as a quartering with their father 's arms , and so consequently to their descendants .
There are , historically , three levels of officers of arms : Kings of Arms , Heralds and Pursuivants .
Furthermore , the Earl Marshal may , in theory , hear cases and controversies relating to the use of arms in the Court of Chivalry , although the court has not sat since 1954 .
The officers of arms occupy posts bearing traditional titles with royal connotations .
This established the system , which is still operated , whereby royal authority to approve candidates for grants of arms is exercised by the Earl Marshal , and royal authority to grant the arms themselves is exercised by the Kings of Arms from the College of Arms .
Although daughters and sons inherit the right to bear arms for themselves personally , the right passes only through the male line : hence , a son transmits the arms to his children , but a daughter , while bearing them for herself , does not transmit them to her children .
If it does proceed , its success or otherwise will depend on the approval of the Earl Marshal , who may apply his own standards .
Before they can even consider the granting of arms , an application must be made to the Earl Marshal , and a fee paid .
Scotland has its own heraldic authority in Lord Lyon King of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon .
The applicant does not buy a coat of arms : the arms themselves are freely given , but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists involved as professionals , and to support the buildings and other running costs of the College .
For these public appearances , the officers of the college wear costume representing their place in the Royal Household , either simple red livery or the herald 's traditional colourful outfit of a tabard emblazoned with his master 's arms ( in this case the royal arms ) .
If a herald is approached and does not consider that the application has merit , he may tactfully suggest to the applicant that he or she should not proceed .
To that end , the college is involved in genealogy and the many pedigrees ( family trees ) in their records , although not open to the public , have official status .
They were fixed at higher levels by James I but reduced by William IV in the 1830s .
The Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent .
The Kings of Arms are authorised in their patents of appointment to grant ( with the consent of the Earl Marshal ) to `` eminent men '' , a phrase which first appeared in the patent of appointment of Stephen Leake as Clarenceux King of Arms in 1741 .
These salaries were set centuries ago and reflect the living costs of the day .
The various officers of arms have their own private practices in heraldry and genealogy , and receive only nominal salaries as officers of the College .
Nor is there any requirement for the College of Arms to approve the use of the arms in each generation : the original grant of arms is the only authority required .
By 1530 , the heralds applied a property qualification , requiring successful candidates for a grant of arms to have an income from land of Â # 10 per annum , or movable wealth of Â # 300 .
The costs involved are quite substantial .
In addition to designing and granting new arms , the College fields many requests from people attempting to demonstrate descent from an armigerous ( arms bearing ) person ; a person descended in the male line ( or through heraldic heiresses ) from such an ancestor may be reissued that ancestor 's arms ( with differencing marks if necessary to distinguish from senior line cousins ) .
But since the heralds receive fees for granting arms , they have always had an incentive to be generous rather than restrictive in their interpretation of who should be allowed a grant .
They , or a differenced version of them using marks of cadency , will be inherited by all of the legitimate children of an individual and such children and their descendants may bear the arms ( or a differenced version of them ) from the moment of birth : they do not ( as with other inheritance ) have to wait for the death of the previous generation .
( The deed poll is not entered on the registers , but is still published , if the name change does not amend the surname . ) It is also possible to change ones arms , with or without adopting or appending a new surname , by Royal Licence , that is to say a licence in the form of a warrant from the Crown directed to the kings of arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name .

The consensus from critics was the film was `` a faithful adaptation of a beloved children 's novel and a powerful portrayal of love , loss , and imagination through children 's eyes .
The film received positive reviews ; critics called it a faithful adaption of the children 's novel , and found dynamic visuals and natural performances further enhanced the imaginative film .
CsupÃ explained that `` it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that we 're not going to overdo the visual effects because of the story 's integrity and the book 's integrity '' , because there was only a brief mention of Jesse and Leslie fighting imaginary creatures in the forest in the novel .
The film is based on the Katherine Paterson novel of the same name , and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures in the US .
Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began , and `` their conversation convinced her that , without a doubt , AnnaSophia was meant for this role '' .
In designing the fantasy creatures found in Terabithia , CsupÃ wanted to make creatures that were `` little more artsy , imaginative , fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies '' , and drew inspiration from Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott .
Morgenstern thought CsupÃ lacked experience directing actors , and that although Deschanel was the best adult performer , she seemed self directed .
The reviewer praised all the leads for their strong performances , especially Deschanel and Madison .
Claudia Puig of USA Today wrote that `` for a movie about the power of imagination , Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever as you would hope '' .
Jessica Grose of The Village Voice commended director CsupÃ for omitting `` cutesy tween stereotypes '' , and felt Jesse 's relationship with his father elevated Bridge to Terabithia from `` a good kids movie to a classic contender '' .

Principal photography was shot in Auckland , New Zealand within sixty days .
CsupÃ stated that he was interested in making the film because he `` had the ambition to do a live action film for a long time '' , but that he `` did n't like anything until I read this book '' .

The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on February 16 , 2007 .
Hornaday wrote that although the final five minutes succumbed to `` oversweet sentiment '' , viewers would remember the film 's `` warmth and respect with which it pays homage to first love '' .
First , natural looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by CsupÃ and Malanitchev , and this was done mostly through Photoshop collages done by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio .
Morgenstern was disappointed with the performances by the young members of the cast , which he described as `` appealing but unpolished '' .
It was a match made in heaven . ''
We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident , brave leader in Terabithia .
That 's a heck of a range for such a young actor . ''
James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia `` easily the best family feature of the early year '' .

He rides the bus to school with his little sister May Belle ( Bailee Madison ) , where he avoids the school bully Janice Avery ( Lauren Clinton ) .
Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun Times praised Hutcherson and Robb 's performances , saying that `` the film 's heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through children 's eyes .
Despite the critical acclaim , not all reviews were as positive .
The film was directed by GÃ bor CsupÃ , who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat .
CsupÃ chose to have Weta Digital render the 3D animation because he `` was impressed with their artistic integrity , the teamwork , the ( fact that ) people were really nice , and also they responded to our designs very positively . ''

The New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background `` to find magic in the everyday '' , and thought CsupÃ directed `` like someone intimate with the pain of being different , allowing each personality more than a single characteristic '' .
Catsoulis found the film was able to handle adult topics `` with nuance and sensitivity '' , and being consistently smart and `` delicate as a spider web '' , it was the kind of children 's movie `` rarely seen nowadays '' .
CsupÃ noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book .

Paterson had asked his mother , Katherine Paterson , if he could write a screenplay of the novel , and she agreed `` not only because he 's ( her ) son , but also because he 's a very good playwright '' .
The score he composed for the film is described as `` very large '' compared to his other work , and Zigman commented that `` Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do , I also like big orchestral stuff , and want to do more of that , and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit . ''
Patrick explained that he related to the story because he was `` constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid '' himself , and that the film 's setting reminded him of where he grew up .

Dima Malanitchev came up with the drawings for the creatures with CsupÃ 's guidance .
Levine said that `` it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie , that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence .
The story was based on his real life best friend , Lisa Hill , who was struck by lightning and killed when they were both eight years old .
CsupÃ said that he cast her because of `` her letter , her enthusiasm , and her love of the material '' .
He described the book as `` beautiful '' and said that it `` moved ( him ) '' .

Hemoglobin has an oxygen binding capacity of 1.34 ml O2 per gram of hemoglobin , which increases the total blood oxygen capacity seventyfold compared to dissolved oxygen in blood . The mammalian hemoglobin molecule can bind ( carry ) up to four oxygen molecules .
The name hemoglobin is derived from the words heme and globin , reflecting the fact that each subunit of hemoglobin is a globular protein with an embedded heme ( or haem ) group . Each heme group contains one iron atom , that can bind one oxygen molecule through ion induced dipole forces .
In general , hemoglobin can be saturated with oxygen molecules ( oxyhemoglobin ) , or desaturated with oxygen molecules ( deoxyhemoglobin ) .
In hemolysis ( accelerated breakdown of red blood cells ) , associated jaundice is caused by the hemoglobin metabolite bilirubin , and the circulating hemoglobin can cause renal failure .

Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the shallower levels of the mantle have produced a thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface , upon which we live .
The gases evolved during the melting of Earth 's mantle have a large effect on the composition and abundance of Earth 's atmosphere .
The exposed site lies approximately three kilometres beneath the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres .
A thin crust , the upper part of the lithosphere , surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75 km thick .
On 5 March 2007 , a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook embarked on a voyage to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle lies exposed without any crust covering , mid way between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean Sea .
Two main zones are distinguished in the upper mantle : the inner asthenosphere composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity , about 200 km thick , and the lowermost part of the lithosphere , composed of rigid rock , about 50 to 120 km thick .
The uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere , an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200 km .

The origins of thrash metal are generally traced to the late 1970s and early 1980s , when a number of bands began incorporating the sound of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , creating a new genre and developing into a separate movement from punk rock and hardcore .
This genre is more aggressive compared to its relative , speed metal , and can be seen in part to be a reaction to the lighter , more widely acceptable sounds and themes of glam metal .
Thrash metal is directly responsible for the offshoot of popular underground metal genres , such as death metal and black metal .

( 2 ) In pizza restaurants ( pizzerias ) , pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape .
This pizza is cooked in long , rectangular baking pans and relatively thick ( 1 â `` 2 cm ) .
It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight .
Neapolitan pizza ( pizza napoletana ) : Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are typically made with tomatoes and Mozzarella cheese .
The crust is similar to that of an English muffin , and the pizza is often cooked in an electric oven .
According to the rules proposed by the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana , the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour ( type 0 or 00 , or a mixture of both ) , natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer 's yeast , salt and water .
Lazio style : Pizza in Lazio ( Rome ) , as well as in many other parts of Italy , is available in two different styles : ( 1 ) Take away shops sell pizza rustica or pizza al taglio .
When cooked , it should be crispy , tender and fragrant .
Valya Mladenova Balkanska ( born 8 January 1942 ) is a Bulgarian folk music singer from the Rhodope Mountains known locally for her wide repertoire of Balkan folksong , but in the West mainly for singing the song `` Izlel e Delyu Haydutin '' , part of the Voyager Golden Record selection of music included in the two Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977 .
In 2002 , Balkanska was awarded the Stara Planina Orden ( the highest Bulgarian award ) .
Her album Glas ot vechnostta ( Voice from the Eternity ) , released in 2004 , is a compilation of her best known songs , including `` A bre yunache ludo i mlado '' , `` Goro le goro zelena '' , and `` Maychinko stara maychinko '' .

It established Boeing as one of the largest makers of passenger aircraft , and led to the later series of aircraft with `` 7x7 '' designations .
Although it was not the first commercial jet in service , the 707 was among the first to be commercially successful .
Dominating passenger air transport in the 1960s , and remaining common throughout the 1970s , the 707 is generally credited with ushering in the Jet Age .
The Boeing 707 is a four engine narrow body commercial passenger jet airliner developed by Boeing in the early 1950s .
Its name is most commonly pronounced as `` Seven Oh Seven '' .
Boeing delivered a total of 1,011 Boeing 707s including a smaller , faster model of the aircraft that was marketed as the Boeing 720 .

He is sometimes regarded as the first person in recorded history to create a multiethnic , centrally ruled empire , although the Sumerians Lugal anne mundu and Lugal zage si also have a claim .
During Sargon 's reign , Akkadian was standardized and adapted for use with the cuneiform script previously used in the Sumerian language .
He ruled from a new capital , Akkad ( Agade ) , which the Sumerian king list claims he built ( or possibly renovated ) , on the left bank of the Euphrates .
Sargon 's vast empire is known to have extended from Elam to the Mediterranean Sea , including Mesopotamia , parts of modern day Iran and Syria , and possibly parts of Anatolia and the Arabian peninsula .

Willem Einthoven ( Semarang , May 21 , 1860 Leiden , September 29 , 1927 ) was a Dutch doctor and physiologist .
He invented the first practical electrocardiogram ( ECG or EKG ) in 1903 and received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1924 for it .
On 5 March 1865 at Wascoe 's Inn in the Blue Mountains on his way to Sydney to seek redress , Pottinger accidentally shot himself in the upper abdomen while boarding a moving coach .
He recovered enough to be moved to the Victoria Club in Sydney where he died intestate on 9 April 1865 and was succeeded by his brother , Henry , as 3rd Baronet .
Posted to the Lachlan , he proved himself an indefatigable but unlucky hunter of bushrangers .
He was buried at St Jude 's Anglican Church , Randwick .
In May 1863 the inspector general had directed the police to act on their own initiative .
Protest meetings against his dismissal were held on the diggings and in the towns , with petitions for his reappointment .
On the night of 9 and 10 August Pottinger and a party of police surrounded the house of Gardiner 's mistress , Kate Brown , but the bushranger escaped when Pottinger 's pistol misfired .
He later captured Patrick Daley , but on 17 August 1864 failed to arrest James Alpin McPherson .
Probably because of conditions imposed by his family who still supported him with funds , Pottinger kept his title secret but in 1860 it was discovered by the inspector general of police , John McLerie , and promotion came rapidly .
On 27 September 1862 Pottinger had appeared before a Bathurst court on a charge of assault .
Under the 1862 Police Regulation Act Pottinger was appointed an inspector of police for the Western District .
They arrested a young boy on suspicion of being an accomplice and allowed him to remain in the lock up without comforts ; his death in March 1863 from gaol fever further diminished Pottinger 's reputation .
In April 1862 he arrested Ben Hall at Forbes on a charge of highway robbery , but he was acquitted .
Soon afterwards Hall joined Frank Gardiner 's gang which on 15 June 1862 robbed the Lachlan escort of some Â # 14,000 .
They escaped several days later in a gun battle but Pottinger recovered the stolen gold taken by the prisoners .
Meanwhile the bushrangers in his district became more active .
Early in January 1865 hoping to lure Hall and his associate , fellow bushranger John Dunn , into the open , Pottinger rode in the Wowingragong races in breach of police regulations .
In November he became clerk of petty sessions at Dubbo and on 1 October 1861 assistant superintendent of the Southern Mounted Patrol .

Jazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz .
For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement .
Jazz piano is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing jazz .
The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception , in both solo and ensemble settings .
Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument 's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities .
Along with the guitar , vibraphone , and other keyboard instruments , the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and chords rather than only single notes as does the saxophone or trumpet .
He currently plays for Kashima Antlers .
Toru Araiba is a Japanese football defender .
It is black and white and was co directed by Melina and Knowles for the B ` Day Anthology Video Album , which was released the same month ; it was one of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album .
Though Knowles is from Texas , she had never previously been on mechanical bull .
Knowles rehearsed the pole dancing using two ballet bars , which was when it was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc .
It begins with Knowles sitting in a chair , wearing men 's clothing and smoking a cigar .
There were no problems during warm ups , but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster , causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot , leaning back and turning around .
The `` Suga Mama '' music video was released to British music channels in April 2007 .
The remainder of the video presents Knowles dancing on top of a sugar cube , dancing with backing dancers whose faces are partially concealed , lying in a circle of light , and riding a mechanical bull .
Knowles said she is meant to `` slowly become a woman '' during the video , adding `` Well , a sexier woman â `` I 'm always a woman . ''
She gets up and begins to pole dance .
The song also derives genres from R&B as well as soul , while sampling Jake Wade and the Soul Searchers ' song `` Searching for Soul '' , written by Chuck Middleton .
To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull , the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second ( see frame rate ) and Knowles sang twice as quickly , but it was n't until 4:00 am that they completed work .

An area of disturbed weather , partially related to the remnants of Tropical Depression Eight , persisted for several days over the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucatan Peninsula .
Although it never attained tropical storm status , the cyclone became better organized , though when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico it was absorbed by a non tropical system on September 30 .
It began a westward drift and dissipated over central Alabama on July 7 .
The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season produced seven named tropical cyclones and three hurricanes , a total below the Atlantic hurricane season average . It officially started on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally limit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean .
A tropical wave entered the area , causing an increase in showers and cloudiness .
The first tropical cyclone , Tropical Storm Alberto , developed on June 30 , while the last storm , Hurricane Gordon , dissipated on November 21 .
The wave moved across the Yucatan Peninsula , and developed into a tropical depression on August 29 in the Bay of Campeche .
Early on July 2 , the depression organized into Tropical Storm Alberto . Alberto peaked as a tropical storm with winds of 65 m , and made landfall near Destin , Florida on July 3 .
The depression slowed its forward motion , and dissipated the next day over Guatemala .
The season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes , which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale .
A tropical wave that was first noted on August 17 tracked westward and reached the Caribbean Sea on August 26 .
Shortly after Tropical Depression Eight dissipated , another tropical depression formed from a well defined circulation that moved off the coast of Africa on September 26 .
The eighth depression of the season formed on September 24 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea .

Jan van Eyck ( or Johannes de Eyck ) ( before c. 1395 â `` before July 9 , 1441 ) was a Flemish painter active in Bruges and considered one of the best Northern European painters of the 15th century .
Jan van Eyck has often been linked as brother to painter and peer Hubert van Eyck , because both have been thought to originate from the same town , Maaseik in Limburg ( Belgium ) . Another brother , Lambert van Eyck is mentioned in Burgundian court documents , and there is a conjecture that he too was a painter , and that he may have overseen the closing of Jan van Eyck 's Bruges workshop .

This last office , the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood , has lain vacant for many years .
According to E.S. Drower , the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features , which appear in various forms in other gnostic sects :
These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized , such as the Mandaeans , Ahl e Haq , and Baha ` i .
The contemporary status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call upon the U.S. government to extend refugee status to the community .
, Neo Mandaic ganzeá rÄ nÄ ) and the riÅ amma `` leader of the people . ''
Mani later left the Elkasaites to found his own religion .
The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century .
One of the chief works of Mandaean scripture , accessible to laymen and initiates alike , is the DraÅ a d Iahia `` The Book of John the Baptist '' ( text ; German translation ) , which includes a dialogue between John and Jesus .
By 2007 , the population of Mandaeans in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000 .
There are small Mandaean diaspora populations in Sweden ( c. 5,000 ) , Australia ( c. 3,500 as of 2006 ) , the USA ( c. 1,500 ) , the UK ( c. 1,000 ) , and Canada .
The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic , and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects .
Many Mandaean lay people do not speak this language , though some members of the Mandaean community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to speak Neo Mandaic , a modern version of this language .
Whether groups such as the Elkasaites , the Mughtasila , the Nasoraeans , and the Dositheans can be identified with the Mandaeans or one another is a difficult question .
Mandaeans recognize several prophets .
While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons , they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one .
Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion but revere him as one of their greatest teachers , tracing their beliefs back to Adam .
In Iran the Gozinesh Law ( passed in 1985 ) has the effect of prohibiting Mandaeans from fully participating in civil life .
The members of this sect , like the Mandaeans , wore white and performed baptisms .
Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation , and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world , placing a high priority upon family life .
The colophons attest to the existence of the Mandaeans during the late Arsacid period at the very latest , a fact corroborated by the HarrÄ n GÄ wetÄ legend , according to which the Mandaeans left Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st c. AD , and settled within the Arsacid empire .
Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires , few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity .
Traditionally , any ganzeá rÄ who baptizes seven or more ganzeá rÄ nÄ may qualify for the office of riÅ amma , though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate .
The Elkasaites were a Judeo Christian baptismal sect which seem to have been related , possibly ancestral , to the Mandaeans ( see Sabians ) .
There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide , and until the 2003 Iraq war , almost all of them lived in Iraq .
A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist .
The members of this sect , like the Mandaeans , wore white and performed baptisms .
Ibn al Nadim also mentions a group called the Mughtasila , `` the self ablutionists '' , who may be identified with one or the other of these groups .
This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts .
Likewise , the Mandaeans believe that Abraham , Moses , and Muhammad were false prophets , but recognize other prophetic figures from the Abrahamic traditions , such as Adam , his sons Hibil ( Abel ) and Å itil ( Seth ) , and his grandson AnuÅ ( Enosh ) , as well as Nuh ( Noah ) , his son Sam ( Shem ) and his son Ram ( Aram ) .
The corpus of Mandaean literature , though quite large , covers topics such as eschatology , the knowledge of God , and the afterlife only in an unsystematic manner , and , apart from the priesthood , is known only to a few laypeople .
In 1831 , an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities .
Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( Mandaic : Mandaiuta , MandÄ ` iyya , ) is a monotheistic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview .
Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the `` Nasoraeans '' , described by Epiphanius , and the Dositheans , mentioned by Theodore Bar KÅ nÄ `` in his Scholion .
Other important books include the QolastÄ , the `` Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans '' , which was translated by E.S. Drower ( much of it is found here and here ) .
The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors .
By consulting the colophons in the Left Ginza , Jorunn J. Buckley has identified an uninterrupted chain of copyists to the late 2nd or early 3rd c. AD .
This law and other gozinesh provisions make access to employment , education , and a range of other areas conditional upon a rigorous ideological screening , the principal prerequisite for which is devotion to the tenets of Islam .
Mandaeans will , however , abstain from strong drink and red meat .
Two of the surviving acolytes ( Å gandia ) , Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun , reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them .
Its adherents , the Mandaeans , revere Adam , Abel , Seth , Enosh , Noah , Shem , Aram and especially John the Baptist .
The Mandaeans have a large corpus of religious scriptures , the most important of which is the GenzÄ RabbÄ or Ginza , a collection of history , theology , and prayers ( German translation available here ) .
They dwelt in east Judea and Assyria , whence the Mandaeans claim to have migrated to southern Mesopotamia , according to the Harran GawaitÄ legend .
At the moment , the highest office currently occupied is that of the ganzeá rÄ , a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis ( ca .
Consequently , Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism .
The Mandaic word k ( a ) daba , however , might be interpreted as being derived from either of two roots : the first root , meaning `` to lie , '' is the one traditionally ascribed to Jesus ; the second , meaning `` to write , '' might provide a second meaning , that of `` book '' ; hence some Mandaeans , motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit , maintain that Jesus was not a `` lying Messiah '' but a `` book Messiah '' , the `` book '' in question presumably being the Christian Gospels .
Mandaeism , as the religion of the Mandaean people , is based more on a common heritage than on any set of religious creeds and doctrines .
This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature , or both derived from the same source .
Mandaeans maintain that Jesus and Muhammad were mÅ iha kdaba `` false messiahs '' who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John .
In a comparative analysis , Mandaean scholar SÃ ve S Ã derberg indicated that Mani 's Psalms of Thomas were closely related to Mandaean texts .
According to the Fihrist of ibn al Nadim , the Mesopotamian prophet Mani , the founder of Manichaeism , was brought up within the Elkasaites ( Elcesaites or Elchasaite ) sect .
Out of the over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s , only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there ; as of early 2007 , over 80 % of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan as a result of the Iraq War .

For road bicycle racing enthusiasts , the mountain can be climbed by three routes .
Mont Ventoux has become legendary as the scene of one of the most gruelling climbs in the Tour de France bicycle race , which has ascended the mountain fourteen times since 1951 .
It is the largest mountain in the region and has been nicknamed the `` Giant of Provence '' , or `` The Bald Mountain '' .
There is a memorial to Simpson near the summit which has become a shrine to fans of cycling , who often leave small tokens of remembrance there .

On May 16 , 2006 , Jean Pascal Roux from BÃ doin broke the record of climbs in 24 hours , with eleven climbs , all of them from BÃ doin .
In 1994 , Eros Poli , not known for his climbing ability , stole away at the beginning of the day 's stage , built up a substantial time gap from the peloton , and was first over the Ventoux and eventual stage winner despite losing a minute of his lead per kilometre of the ascent .
Jean Buridan climbed the mountain early in the fourteenth century ; Petrarch ( accompanied by his brother ) repeated the feat on April 26 , 1336 , and claimed to have been the first to climb the mountain since antiquity , which has been widely repeated since .
Every year there are amateur races to climb the mountain as quickly and often as possible in 24 hours , the Ventoux Masterseries and `` Les CinglÃ s du Mont Ventoux '' .

IDEA is an optional algorithm in the OpenPGP standard .
Each round uses six 16 bit sub keys , while the half round uses four , a total of 52 for 8.5 rounds .
IDEA operates on 64 bit blocks using a 128 bit key , and consists of a series of eight identical transformations ( a round , see the illustration ) and an output transformation ( the half round ) .
IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups modular addition and multiplication , and bitwise eXclusive OR ( XOR ) which are algebraically `` incompatible '' in some sense .
The processes for encryption and decryption are similar .
As of 2007 , the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA reduced to 6 rounds ( the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds ) .
( Applied Cryptography , 2nd ed . )
Bruce Schneier thought highly of IDEA in 1996 , writing , `` In my opinion , it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time . ''
The designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions .
However , by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster algorithms , some progress in its cryptanalysis , and the issue of patents .
Today , IDEA is licensed in all the countries where it is patented by MediaCrypt .
In cryptography , the International Data Encryption Algorithm ( IDEA ) is a block cipher designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai and was first described in 1991 .
IDEA is a minor revision of an earlier cipher , PES ( Proposed Encryption Standard ) ; IDEA was originally called IPES ( Improved PES ) .
The first eight sub keys are extracted directly from the key , with K1 from the first round being the lower sixteen bits ; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits between each group of eight .
The cipher is patented in a number of countries but is freely available for non commercial use .
The name `` IDEA '' is also a trademark .
The algorithm was intended as a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard ( DES ) .

The concept of context assumes significance in the case of interruptible tasks , wherein upon being interrupted the processor saves the context and proceeds to serve the Interrupt service routine .
In computer science , a task context ( process , thread ... ) is the minimal set of data used by this task that must be saved to allow a task interruption at a given date , and a continuation of this task at the point it has been interrupted and at an arbitrary future date .
In small quantities sorrel is harmless ; in large quantities it can be fatal .
It has whorled spikes of reddish green flowers , which bloom in summer , becoming purplish .
The leaves may be purÃ ed in soups and sauces or added to salads and shav ; they have a flavor that is similar to kiwifruit or sour wild strawberries .
The stamens and pistils are on different plants ( dioecious ) ; the ripe seeds are brown and shining .
Sorrel is a slender plant about 60 cm high , with roots that run deep into the ground , as well as juicy stems and edible , oblong leaves .
Other names for sorrel include spinach dock and narrow leaved dock .
The plant 's sharp taste is due to oxalic acid , which is a poison .

The general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles expressed in the Virginia Resolutions .
In the 1957 Roth v. United States opinion by William Brennan , Madison 's Report is cited as evidence that `` the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth . ''
As well , Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional .
In defense of Virginia Democratic Republicans and the Resolutions , Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory , the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests , which states were surely entitled to produce .
Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not .
Though it had little impact on the immediate election , Madison 's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states ' rights in general , particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy .
The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832 , when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state .
To remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts , Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech .
Freedom of the press was necessary , because `` chequered as it is with abuses , the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression . ''
Contrary to the Sedition Act , the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack , beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen ; indeed , such special intervention against the press was `` expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution . ''
The measure came before the House of Delegates , the lower house of the General Assembly , on January 2 .
These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional , and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary .
However , James Monroe , who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year , visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison , since another meeting between two of the most important Democratic Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment .
The state governments themselves , no less than the federal judiciary , possess only delegated power and therefore can not decide questions of fundamental importance .
This resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions .
Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact .
The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact , and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power .
The Report was received warmly by Virginia Democratic Republicans .
The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens .
The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts , four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will , required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens , and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials .
Henry Clay said on the floor of the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800 , above other documents , that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation .
At the time , some leading Virginia Democratic Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles ( in public ) and Taylor ( in private ) actually were contemplating disunion , and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond , so there was some truth to the charge .
They were `` expressions of opinion , unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection . ''
The Resolutions , usually discussed together with Thomas Jefferson 's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions , were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist dominated national government .
The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures .
The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state , but there was not much public response to the Report , and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 ( which was , nevertheless , a major victory for the Democratic Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies ) .
Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified `` protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution '' as one of the four primary elements of the Democratic Republican Party plan .
Adopted by the Virginia General Assembly in January 1800 , the Report amends arguments from the 1798 Virginia Resolutions and attempts to resolve contemporary criticisms against the Resolutions .
Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to `` a protection of those who administer the government , if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people , against being exposed to it . ''
In more recent years , the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment .
H. Jefferson Powell , a modern jurist , identifies three persistent themes of Democratic Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report : ( 1 ) a textual approach to the Constitution , ( 2 ) the compact theory , and ( 3 ) that caution , not trust , should characterize our approach to those who hold political power .
A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly 's 1798 Virginia Resolutions , of which Madison had been the draftsman .
The Report of 1800 , Madison argued , did not say the government was a compact of the individual states , as the pro nullification elements suggested .
Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers ' ideas on free speech .
The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly , led in the effort by state sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline , had put a state sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison 's hopes .
The Report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by James Madison arguing for the sovereignty of the individual states under the United States Constitution and against the Alien and Sedition Acts .
However , Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro nullification Southerners .
Once at Richmond , Madison began drafting the Report , though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery .
The Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Democratic Republican principles .
In modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states ' rights with regard to federalism and republicanism .
The Virginia Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures , including those of New York , Delaware , and the five New England states .
Madison , a member of the Democratic Republican Party , was elected to the Democratic Republican dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799 .
Despite Jefferson 's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison 's work , the national reaction was tepid .
Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union , which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above .
The Assembly session began in early December .
The Federalists accused the Democratic Republicans of seeking disunion , even contemplating violence .
Democratic Republicans were outraged by the legislation , and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures .
Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of `` the people in each of the States , acting in their highest sovereign capacity . ''
The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the 1817 Bonus Bill veto message by Madison , who has come to be regarded as the `` Father of the Constitution . ''
More generally , the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states , for which it is best known .
The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that when the Virginians claimed that the `` states '' were parties to the federal Constitution , the referent of the word `` state '' was the sovereign people of the particular state .
Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon , examining Jefferson 's later writing , conclude that Madison had a significant role `` in softening Jefferson 's more extreme views . ''
This doctrine is known as the compact theory .
At the very least , Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic Republicans .
The committee members were Madison , John Taylor , William Branch Giles , George Keith Taylor , John Wise , John Mercer , and William Daniel .
At some point in the next two weeks , it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6 .
Spencer Roane described it as `` the Magna Charta on which the republicans settled down , after the great struggle in the year 1799 . ''
On December 23 , Madison moved for the creation of a special seven member committee with himself as chairman to respond to `` certain answers from several of the states , relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session . ''
Either formulation would help the Democratic Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary , both of which were dominated by Federalists .
The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment .
The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40 .
In response to this letter , Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello during the first week of September .
The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison .
Jefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at Montpelier on his way to Philadelphia , the national capital , for the winter session of the United States Congress .
While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press , but implying that such power existed , Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press .
Whether Madison 's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement , and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period , are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature .
Madison rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice .
It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic Republicans as leaning toward secession ; in the amended Report the line is moderated , with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people ( and therefore , one reads in , not the state legislatures alone ) which possess this power .
Laying into the Acts in his Report , Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits .
The next day , Christmas Eve , the committee produced a first version of the Report .
By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion , Madison tried to make clear that the Democratic Republicans were not moving toward disunion .

A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line ups .
It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence , particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll , Ensiferum , Korpiklaani , Turisas , and Moonsorrow .
Despite their contributions , folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s .
It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe as well as in Israel .
As the name suggests , the genre is a fusion of heavy metal with traditional folk music .
Among these early groups , the Irish band Cruachan and the German band Subway to Sally each spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as Celtic metal and medieval metal respectively .
Folk metal is a sub genre of heavy metal music that developed in Europe during the 1990s .
A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments .
Lyrics in the genre commonly deal with paganism , nature , fantasy , mythology and history .
The earliest exponent of folk metal was the English band Skyclad .
Their debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in 1990 .
This includes the widespread use of folk instruments and , to a lesser extent , traditional singing styles .
The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music .

Each of these variants can bind to a different target , known as an antigen .
Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a paratope ( a structure analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( that is equivalent to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision .
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes .
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target , termed an antigen .
It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies , each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen .
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) .
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen binding sites , to exist .

: : : ( This essay is a draft to be expanded later . )
Rather than maintaining some basic , core levels of simplicity , the multiple nerdisms start interfering with earlier peculiar features , and the result becomes conflicting nerdisms with almost unpredictable , expanding quirks .
Do n't design coding as quotebox .
The exact causes , behind each quirk , are perhaps too complex to explain in this essay .
Perhaps the world is seeing a rapid growth in the rise of `` nerdnology '' as typical notions of quality control have been abandoned , almost everywhere .
Instead , the quirks are not the work of college dropout billionaires , but rather just a collection of misdirected changes .
So even an organization with $ billions of revenue can not seem to avoid utterly spastic , peculiar quirks in their webpages .
In the second use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 is only `` aaa '' because the vertical bar ( or pipe ) '' '' stopped param1 from including the line break newline .
Kids do n't do this .
Those preferences could be set to overcome some design flaws in the basic design of a system ( such as a browser ) , until the more normal settings are preset as the defaults in later software versions .
For example , in some mainsteam browsers :
, some really bizarre features are added , such as allowing wiki templates to pass newlines at the end of parameter values , simply by indenting the next line , when calling a template .
Unfortunately , `` one man 's bizarreness is other man 's ordinary dork otopia '' and some developers think that everyone should change their ways to adjust to the new stuff .
Even Google Inc. , with all the $ billions , has had some very unusual things happening in the official websites ( for years ) :
Overly often , peculiar ideas are treated as mainstream `` everyone should know nerdisms '' which become some of the widespread quirks that appear , from day to day .
Ah so , oh so important quotebox he look like : Me is quotebox â `` I so cool , so important .
This essay , WP : Avoiding Wikipedia quirks , is intended to try to explain what is happening , hourly , to Wikipedia , and to suggest work around solutions .
Wikipedia 's underlying software system , with the MediaWiki markup language , is constantly being changed to fix old problems and try to offer new , better features , but better for whom ?
Not all problems are caused by Wikipedia 's software configuration .
However , along with that stuff , there is a 2nd language as wikitable codes ( in Table ) , so that a table begins with '' '' which formerly were required in column 1 but can be indented now ( at least sometimes , or maybe not whatever ) .
Everything is changing , without warning , and lots of it is quirky .
The most normal language is the typical free flowing text that allows triple quote ` bold font ' , along with the HTML tags , such as .
In the first use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 can be considered to be `` xxx '' because the coding was split , with param2 ( value `` yyy '' ) on the 2nd line .
Normally , bizarre features would be designed to require special coding to trigger those features , such as : if you want to pass newlines in parameter values , then specify them , explicitly , such as `` param = aa # nuline ; bb # nuline ; cc # nuline ; '' where the code '' # nuline ; '' or '' '' ( or some other invented thing ) is the feature to be requested .
No longer are major changes tested on a sample user group , but instead , released untested to the entire world .
However , imagine the stress on the Wikipedia developers , having to ensure that any changes or enhancements , to the MediaWiki interfaces , must continue to work as before , generating the same demented , peculiar sets of quotebox indentations , everywhere they had popped up before .
By considering the design flaws , and the operational instability , it is possible to get a better understanding of the psychological pressures that people face when using Wikipedia .
Many problems are actually from each user 's PC setup or browser , such as pressing F5 ( before edit preview ) and losing all edit text ( see below : Browser nightmares ) .
There are hundreds of unusual , or unexpected quirks or glitches in the way things sort of do , sort of don ' t work .
The quirks are not merely planned obsolescence , similar to allowing computer viruses , which are known to kill user computers and cause people to buy new or fix it software products ( as the planned result ) .
All of those problems are caused by quirky browser operation ( not Wikipedia ) , as the browser does not reflect the way that people actually think .
Me is quotebox â `` wiki would die without me .
Knowing the details , about specific quirks , can help avoid the stress or frustrations in the future .
On any given day , new problems might arise , or old problems get fixed , as the developers adjust the servers or hack the MediaWiki code to alter character shift typesetting for the 200 + Wikipedia languages ( see below : Why quirks occur ) .
Even the most level headed , otherwise normal software developers will become overwhelmed by the pre exising nerdisms , so that even simple changes can introduce new quirks , and hence , no single group of people can be blamed for the combined , bizarre outcomes .
Many problems that users think are caused by Wikipedia are actually caused by limited Web browsers .
Well , as can be expected with multiple personality disorder ( MPD ) , the 3 languages fight for power : when HTML code is formatted with typical indentation , the me is quotebox personality , at times , hijacks the page , and you get hypertext markup laughter displayed in a box that looks like ( ... wait for it ... ) a QuoteBox !
Wikipedia is not alone in having many website quirks .
Then there is the 3rd language : the `` infamous '' if you indent , you get `` quotebox '' yes the all important quotebox , which in computer typesetting typically requires only 2 markers ; instead , just indent and the whole section turns into quotebox â `` quotebox â `` quotebox .
Many changes are made to support the unusual typesetting needs of rare written languages that use split character placement of text or other unusual options not seen in English or other European languages .
Complicating the complications is the reality that , eventually , several multiple nerdisms are implemented .
The MediaWiki markup language is a peculiar twisto mash of 3 computer languages .
Far surpassing `` creeping featurism '' the total system becomes `` featured creepyism '' .
The above text , with the multi line footnote shows use of 4 HTML comment lines '' '' to simulate indenting by putting each text segment on a separate line .
Sometimes ( or often ? )
Me is quotebox â `` I exist here 8 years plus forever .
When the template begins to process `` xxx '' then the newline might be seen as an indentation , within the template , so the template would start considering all subsequent lines to be part of the oh so important quotebox , generated now in the middle of the template procedural coding .
So , anyway , put all 3 schidzo languages , blended together , and you get MediaWiki markup ( or markdown ? )
However , some general principles can explain how the problems have arisen , over the years .
The English Wikipedia is impacted because all 200 + languages share some common software , and that software gets changed for everyone .

The full explanation of the tengwar was published in Appendix E of The Lord of the Rings in 1955 .
The tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s .
Later a great number of languages of Middle earth were written using the tengwar , including Sindarin . Tolkien used tengwar to write English : most of Tolkien 's tengwar samples are actually in English .
Some modes , called Ã matehtar ( or vowel tehtar ) modes , are abugidas representing vowels with diacritics called tehtar ( `` signs '' ; corresponding singular : tehta , `` sign '' ) , while other modes , called full writing modes , represent vowels by full letters .
Tolkien used tengwar to write English : most of Tolkien 's tengwar samples are actually in English .
The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription , the first published tengwar sample , dates to 1937 ( The Hobbit , most editions ) .
The sarati , described in Parma Eldalamberon 13 , a script developed by J. R. R. Tolkien in the late 1910s , anticipates many features of the tengwar , especially the vowel representation by diacritics ( which is found in many tengwar varieties ) , different tengwar shapes and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features ( though inconsistent ) .
In his fictional universe , the tengwar were invented by the Elf FÃ `` anor , and used first to write the Elven tongues : Quenya , Telerin , and also Valarin . Later a great number of languages of Middle earth were written using the tengwar , including Sindarin .

Peter Ahlwardts ( `` Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning '' , 1745 ) advised individuals seeking cover from lightning to go anywhere except in or around a church .
Early on , Christian churches tried to prevent the occurrence of the damaging effects of lightning by prayers .
A lightning rod ( US , AUS ) or lightning conductor ( UK ) is a metal rod or conductor mounted on top of a building and electrically connected to the ground through a wire , to protect the building in the event of lightning .
Balls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects .
The patent was granted due to a fault in Franklin 's original theory of operation ; the pointed lightning rod actually ionizes the air around itself , rendering the air conductive , which in turn raises the probability of a strike .
Many years after receiving his patent , in 1919 Dr. Tesla wrote an article for The Electrical Experimenter entitled `` Famous Scientific Illusions '' , in which he explains the logic of Franklin 's pointed lightning rod and discloses his improved method and apparatus .
The idea was that glass objects , being non conductors , are seldom struck by lightning .
The church tower of many European cities , usually the highest structure , was the building often hit by lightning .
In the 19th century , the lightning rod became a decorative motif .
Lightning rods were embellished with ornamental glass balls ( now prized by collectors ) .
The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has been used in weather vanes .
In the United States , the pointed lightning rod conductor , also called a `` lightning attractor '' or `` Franklin rod , '' was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1749 as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity .
Lightning can damage structures made of most materials ( masonry , wood , concrete and steel ) as the huge currents involved can heat materials , causing a potential for fire , and also water to high temperatures .
Franklin speculated that , with an iron rod sharpened to a point at the end ,
The random behavior of lightning combined with observers ' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin 's initial work .
A lightning rod is a single component in a lightning protection system .
Franklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment .
Nikola Tesla 's was an improvement in lightning protectors .
Priests prayed , `` temper the destruction of hail and cyclones and the force of tempests and lightning ; check hostile thunders and great winds ; and cast down the spirits of storms and the powers of the air . ''
Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast .
`` The electrical fire would , I think , be drawn out of a cloud silently , before it could come near enough to strike ... ''
This experiment , in fact , took place because he was tired of waiting for Christ Church in Philadelphia to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it .
Therefore , goes the theory , there must be something about glass that repels lightning .

`` Owen : the most distinguished vertebrate zoologist and palaeontologist ... but a most deceitful and odious man . ''
A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate sub class of the Mammalia ( see Man 's place in nature ) .
In the second part of his career his reputation slipped .
Also , his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on .
`` It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me '' .
Owen in Darwin 's opinion was `` Spiteful , extremely malignant , clever ; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about '' .
This was not the first or last time Owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own , when in fact it was not .
In the first part of his career he was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age .
In this Owen had no supporters at all .
Owen famously credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the Iguanodon , completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur , Gideon Mantell .
Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society 's Zoological Council for plagiarism .
This was not solely due to his underhanded dealings with colleagues ; it was also due to the serious errors of scientific judgement which were discovered and publicized .
Sir Richard Owen , KCB ( 20 July 1804 18 December 1892 ) was an English biologist , comparative anatomist and palaeontologist .
Despite originally starting out on good terms with Darwin , Owen was highly critical of the Origin in large part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution that had been proposed by people like Chambers and himself , and instead compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible .

is a song by the English rock band Oasis , written by the band 's lead guitarist Noel Gallagher .
With the psychedelic and Eastern sound , the song also reminds of George Harrison achievements like `` Within You Without You '' and also some of his solo work .
However , despite the high quality production , the song was not well received by the critics , NME said that the production `` triumphs over any real sort of feeling ... pure mock Maharishi spirituality that not even Liam can salvage from the realm of self parody '' .
Though the single was a success , it failed to achieve a Silver or better sales certification in the UK unlike the previous 11 British Oasis singles .

Royal Commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy .
These can be matters such as government structure , the treatment of minorities , events of considerable public concern or economic questions .
Consequently governments are usually very careful about framing the Terms of Reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish .
In Australia and particularly New South Wales Royal Commissions have been investigations into police and government corruption and organised crime using the very broad coercive powers of the Royal Commissioner to defeat the protective systems that powerful , but corrupt , public officials had used to shield themselves from conventional investigation .
In other cases , where the Commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms , the commission has been dissolved by a superior court .
In practice unlike lesser forms of inquiry once a Commission has started the government can not stop it .
The results of Royal Commissions are published in , often , massive reports of findings containing policy recommendations .
The Warrant may grant immense investigatory powers , including summoning witnesses under oath , offering of indemnities , seizing of documents and other evidence ( sometimes including those normally protected , such as classified information ) , holding hearings in camera if necessary and in a few cases compelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the Commission .

Admiral Arthur Phillip RN ( 11 October 1738 â `` 31 August 1814 ) was a British admiral and colonial administrator .
In 1778 Britain was again at war , and Phillip was recalled to active service , and in 1779 obtained his first command , the Basilisk .
Phillip soon decided that this site , chosen on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks , who had accompanied James Cook in 1770 , was not suitable , since it had poor soil , no secure anchorage and no reliable water source .
In 1762 he was promoted to Lieutenant , but was placed on half pay when the Seven Years War ended in 1763 .
The leading ship , HMS Supply reached Botany Bay setting up camp on the Kurnell Peninsula , on 18 January 1788 .
Phillip joined the Royal Navy at about fifteen , and saw action at the outbreak of the Seven Years ' War in the Mediterranean at the Battle of Minorca in 1756 .
Everything a new colony might need had to be taken , since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there .
Robertson also believes it was a `` disgraceful slur '' on Phillip 's legacy that he was not buried in one of England 's great cathedrals and was relegated to a small village church .
After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson , and on 26 January the marines and convicts were landed at Sydney Cove , which Phillip named after Lord Sydney .
The First Fleet , of 11 ships , set sail on 13 May 1787 .

In 1938 , the first President , Douglas Hyde lived there temporarily while plans were made to build a new presidential palace on the grounds .
By 1945 it had become too closely identified with the presidency of Ireland to be demolished , though its poor condition meant that extensive demolition and rebuilding of parts of the building were necessary , notably the kitchens , servants ' quarters and chapel .
The original house was designed by park ranger and amateur architect , Nathaniel Clements in the mid eighteenth century .
However , in 1990 Mary Robinson moved back to the older main building .
The Chief Secretary for Ireland ( the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs ) , Lord Frederick Cavendish , and the Undersecretary ( chief civil servant ) , Thomas Henry Burke , were stabbed to death with surgical knives while walking back to the residence from Dublin Castle .
It is located in the Phoenix Park on the northside of Dublin .

In 1882 , its grounds became the location for a famous murder .
With the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 , the office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished .
In 1911 , the house underwent a large extension for the visit of King George V and Queen Mary .
The house in the park later became the Viceregal Lodge , the `` out of season '' residence of the Lord Lieutenant ( also known as the Viceroy ) , where he lived for most of the year from the 1820s onwards .
Various visiting British monarchs stayed at the Viceregal Lodge , notably Queen Victoria and George V. American presidents hosted here include Presidents John F. Kennedy , Richard Nixon , Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton , all of Irish descent .
The house was left empty for some years , until the office of President of Ireland was created in 1937 .
Later presidents moved to the new residential wing attached to the main house that had been built on for the visit of King George V in 1911 .
Ã ras an UachtarÃ in is now open for free tours every Saturday .
The first President , Douglas Hyde lived in the residential quarters on the first floor of the main building .
The outbreak of World War II saved the building , which had been renamed Ã ras an UachtarÃ in ( meaning house of the president in Irish ) , from demolition , as plans for its demolition and the design of a new residence were put on hold .

The second tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season , the system developed as an extratropical cyclone to the southeast of Nantucket , Massachusetts , on July 16 from a dissipating cold front .
Moving northeastward over warm water temperatures of 80 â `` 82 Â F ( 27 â `` 28 Â C ) , the trough weakened , and late on July 16 the system separated itself from the dissipating cold front .
A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States late on July 13 and subsequently stalled over the western Atlantic Ocean .
It tracked northeastward over warm water temperatures , and on July 17 transitioned into a tropical storm after an area of convection developed over the center .
The storm quickly weakened as the convection rapidly diminished , and on July 18 it degenerated into a non convective remnant low .
Shortly thereafter , a large burst of convection developed near the center , and it is estimated the system transitioned into a tropical depression early on July 17 while located about 240 miles ( 390 km ) southeast of Nantucket , Massachusetts .

The lost energy converts into heat , which raises the temperature of the system .
Dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy .
Such systems are called dissipative systems .
In computational physics , numerical dissipation ( also known as `` numerical diffusion '' ) refers to certain side effects that may occur as a result of a numerical solution to a differential equation .
Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades , where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force .
In physics , dissipation embodies the concept of a dynamical system where important mechanical models , such as waves or oscillations , lose energy over time , typically from friction or turbulence .
The precise nature of the effects depends on the nature of the wave : an atmospheric wave , for instance , may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass , and at higher levels due to radiative cooling .
Various devices are designed in streambeds to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms .
When the pure advection equation , which is free of dissipation , is solved by a numerical approximation method , the energy of the initial wave may be reduced in a way analogous to a diffusional process . Such a method is said to contain ` dissipation ' .
For example , a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate .

The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction .
If a road goes directly up the hill , then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40 % .
Consider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field , , so at each point the temperature is ( we will assume that the temperature does not change in time ) .
Suppose that the steepest slope on a hill is 40 % .
At each point in the room , the gradient of at that point will show the direction the temperature rises most quickly .
Consider a surface whose height above sea level at a point is .
The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector .
For example , if the angle between the road and the uphill direction , projected onto the horizontal plane , is 60 Â , then the steepest slope along the road will be 20 % , which is 40 % times the cosine of 60 Â .
The gradient of at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point .
A generalization of the gradient for functions on a Euclidean space which have values in another Euclidean space is the Jacobian .
If , instead , the road goes around the hill at an angle ( the gradient vector ) , then it will have a shallower slope .
The gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions , rather than just the direction of greatest change , by taking a dot product .
In vector calculus , the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field , and whose magnitude is the greatest rate of change .

Seventy six trains out of a fleet of 88 are needed to run the line 's peak service , and one unit ( 166 566 366 ) was severely damaged by the terrorist attack of 7 July 2005 .
( In order from east to west . )
Trains will also make an additional stop at during early mornings and late evenings but will not stop at the station during the main part of the day .
The Piccadilly line was to be upgraded in 2014 15 and would have had new trains as well as new signalling .
Bids for the rolling stock order were submitted in 2008 .
This would have increased the line 's capacity by some 24 % .
The line is controlled from the control center at Earl 's Court , which it used to share with the District line .
Out of the 53 stations served , 25 are underground .
The line was previously worked by 1959 stock , 1956 stock , 1938 stock , standard tube stock and 1906 gate stock .
Other services operate at times , especially at the start and towards the end of the traffic day .
The stock was recently refurbished , and was due for replacement by 2014 , but the order for new trains was canceled in July 2010 .
The line has two depots , at Northfields and Cockfosters .
It is the second longest line on the system , after the Central Line .
It is the fifth busiest line on the Underground network judged by the number of passengers transported per year .
However , after the acquisition of Tube Lines by Transport for London in June 2010 , this order was canceled .
Like virtually all Underground lines , the Piccadilly line is operated by a single type of rolling stock , in this case the 1973 tube stock , in the standard London Underground livery of blue , white and red .
It is in need of resignalling , and this work is planned to be carried out by 2014 .
Often late evening services terminate at instead of Cockfosters .

GÃ del 's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that establish inherent limitations of all but the most trivial axiomatic systems for mathematics .
For example , one might take all true statements about the natural numbers to be axioms ( and no false statements ) , which gives the theory known as `` true arithmetic '' .
The two results are widely interpreted as showing that Hilbert 's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible , thus giving a negative answer to Hilbert 's second problem .
The theorems , proven by Kurt GÃ del in 1931 , are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics .

In 1892 , Pulitzer offered Columbia University 's president , Seth Low , money to set up the world 's first school of journalism .
Pulitzer 's already failing health deteriorated rapidly and he withdrew from the daily management of the newspaper , although he continued to actively manage the paper from his vacation retreat in Bar Harbor , Maine , and his New York mansion .
After the World exposed an illegal payment of $ 40 million by the United States to the French Panama Canal Company in 1909 , Pulitzer was indicted for libeling Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan .
In 1872 , Pulitzer purchased a share in the Westliche Post for $ 3,000 , and then sold his stake in the paper for a profit in 1873 .
This competition with Hearst , particularly the coverage before and during the Spanish American War , linked Pulitzer 's name with yellow journalism .
In 1989 Pulitzer was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame .
He is interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx , New York .
In 1884 , he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , but resigned after a few months ' service on account of the pressure of journalistic duties .

In efforts to protect the remaining population , three potoroos ( one male and two females ) were translocated to Bald Island in August 2005 where they are free from predation .
A few young were born in the first couple of years , but then breeding stopped for no known reason .
Liz Sinclair had been doing research on wallabies and caught the potoroo in one of her traps .
Potoroos live under dense bushes and shrubs .
If the first baby does not go to term , this allows a second baby to start growing right away .
This small population size is what has made them be listed as critically endangered .
They have the ability to keep a second embryo in a state of diapause while the first embryo is growing .
Australia has the majority of different kinds of truffles and Potoroos like to eat a variety of them .
Since that time an additional four potoroos have been sent to establish a breeding colony .
It is described as pointed in the face and about the size of a rabbit .
The female potoroos can have two babies in a year , while carrying only one at a time .
The species was thus considered extinct for 120 years before it was re discovered in 1994 in Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve .
Potoroos are nocturnal and spend their days hiding under the dense thicket and rarely cross over large areas .

It is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research .
EC50 also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50 % of a maximum effect in vivo .
This quantitative measure indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance ( inhibitor ) is needed to inhibit a given biological process ( or component of a process , i.e. an enzyme , cell , cell receptor or microorganism ) by half .
According to the FDA , IC50 represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50 % inhibition in vitro .
It is comparable to an EC50 for agonist drugs .
Sometimes , it is also converted to the pIC50 scale ( log IC50 ) , in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency .
In other words , it is the half maximal ( 50 % ) inhibitory concentration ( IC ) of a substance ( 50 % IC , or IC50 ) .

Hasek has won the most under the current system of honoring the best individual goalie .
The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a new award for the goaltender ( s ) of the team that surrenders the fewest goals in regular season play .
Since 1981 , the Vezina Trophy has been awarded by the NHL general managers to the most outstanding goaltender .
It was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence a change was made to offer the William M. Jennings Trophy to the goaltender ( s ) playing for the team with the fewest goals against . Since 1981 , the Vezina Trophy has been awarded by the NHL general managers to the most outstanding goaltender .
Chuck Rayner was the only goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy , but never the Vezina .
Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 28 times .
There are only three players that have won both the Vezina and Hart Memorial Trophy for the same season : Jacques Plante , who won both trophies for the 1961 â `` 62 season ; Dominik Hasek who won both for the 1996 â `` 97 and 1997 â `` 98 seasons ; and Jose Theodore , who won the Vezina and Hart for the 2001 â `` 02 NHL season .

Zemst is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant .
One could therefore wonder whether these were medical models , the town of Smyrna being reputed for its medical school .
The style is reminiscent of Pompei and is situated much more on the side of the grand contemporary paintings than on the heritage of the red figure pottery .
These vases are characterized by a base painted pink .
The sculptors , imitating the preceding centuries , portray painful moments rendered expressive with three dimensional compositions , often V shaped , and anatomical hyper realism .
In the great statuary , the artist explores themes such as suffering , sleep or old age .
Recent archeological discoveries at the cemetery of Pagasae ( close to modern Volos ) , at the edge of the Pagasetic Gulf , or again at Vergina ( 1987 ) , in the former kingdom of Macedonia , have brought to light some original works .
The neck is decorated with ornamental motifs while four satyrs in high relief are casually seated on the shoulders of the vase .
However , these newer colors are more delicate and do not support heat .
The Hellenistic period is equally the time of development of the mosaic , particularly with the works of Sosos of Pergamon , active in the 2nd century BC and the only mosaic artist cited by Pliny ( XXXVI , 184 ) .
The painting occurred therefore after firing , contrary to the traditional practice .
Few examples of Greek wall paintings have survived the centuries .
The figurines were equally fashionable .
Their mother Gaia , come to their aid , can do nothing and must watch them twist in pain under the blows of the gods .
The Hellenistic period produced some masterpieces like the Gonzaga cameo , now in the Hermitage Museum , and spectacular hardstone carvings like the Cup of the Ptolemies in Paris .
It concerns cutting in relief on a stone composed of several colored layers , allowing the object to be presented in relief with more than one color .
Starting from a simple fortress located on the Acropolis , the various Attalid kings set up a colossal architectural complex .
Previously reserved for religious use , in Hellenistic Greece the terra cotta figurine was more frequently used for funerary , and even decorative , purposes .
Pergamon did not distinguish itself with its architecture alone : it was also the seat of a brilliant school of sculpture called Pergamene Baroque .
The most representative copies of this style come from Centuripe in Sicily , where a workshop was active until the 3rd century BC .
Molded glass continued , notably in the creation of intaglio jewelry .
The work on metal vases took on a new fullness : the artists competed among themselves with great virtuosity .
It is decorated with a 32 centimetre tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads .
Because of this , only the smaller objects still exist .
Artemis Rospigliosi of the Louvre is probably a copy of one of them ; as for copies of the Dying Gaul , they were very numerous in the Roman period .
The Olympians triumph in it , each on his side , over Giants most of which are transformed into savage beasts : serpents , birds of prey , lions or bulls .
It was the time of gigantism : thus it was for the second temple of Apollo at Didyma , situated twenty kilometers from Miletus in Ionia .
The fragility of the pigments preventing frequent use of these vases , they were reserved for use in funerals .
The jewellers of the time excelled at handling details and filigrees : thus , the funeral wreaths present very realistic leaves of trees or stalks of wheat .
The art of glass developed especially in Italy .
The shapes of the vases are also inspired by the tradition of metal : thus with the lagynos ( pictured here ) , a wine jar typical of the period .
In parallel there subsisted a tradition of polychromatic figurative painting : the artists sought a greater variety of tints than in the past .
In it one sees four doves perched on the edge of a basin filled with water .
For example , the tomb said to be that of Philip II has provided a great frieze representing a royal lion hunt , remarkable by its composition , the arrangement of the figures in space and its realistic representation of nature .
Certain mosaics , however , provide a pretty good idea of the `` grand painting '' of the period : these are copies of frescoes .
The `` grotesques '' are equally common at Tarsus and also at Alexandria .
One such is the Barberini Faun of Munich , representing a sleeping satyr with relaxed posture and anxious face , perhaps the prey of nightmares .
The art of engraving gems hardly advanced at all , limiting itself to mass produced items that lacked originality .
Sometimes , they were reduced to echoing a form from the great sculptures : thus one finds numerous copies in miniature of the Tyche ( good luck ) of Antioch , of which the original dates to the beginning of the 3rd century BC .
It is believed to be a copy of a painting described by Pliny the Elder ( XXXV , 110 ) which had been painted by Philoxenus of Eretria for King Cassander of Macedon at the end of the 4th century BC , or even of a painting by Apelles contemporaneous with Alexander himself .
Attalus I ( 269 197 BC ) , to commemorate his victory at Caicus against the Gauls â '' called Galatians by the Greeks â '' had two series of votive groups sculpted : the first , consecrated on the Acropolis of Pergamon , includes the famous Gaul killing himself and his wife , of which the original is lost ( the best copy is in the Massimo alle Terme museum of Rome , see illustration ) ; the second group , offered to Athens , is composed of small bronzes of Greeks , Amazons , gods and giants , Persians and Gauls .
The evolution is similar for the art of jewellery .
Fortunately , during Hellenistic Greece , the raw materials were plentiful following eastern conquests .
An example is the Alexander Mosaic , showing the confrontation of the young conqueror and the Grand King Darius III at the Battle of Issus , a mosaic from a floor in the House of the Faun at Pompeii ( now in Naples ) .
Another phenomenon appears in Hellenistic sculpture : privatization , which involves the recapture of older public patterns in decorative sculpture .
The mosaic allows us to admire the choice of colors , the composition of the ensemble with turning movement and facial expressivity .
In Tanagra , in Boeotia , the figurines , full of lively colors , most often represent elegant women in scenes full of charm .
One of them is watering herself while the others seem to be resting , which creates effects of reflections and shadow perfectly studied by the artist .
At Smyrna , in Asia Minor , two major styles occurred side by side : first of all , copies of masterpieces of great sculpture , such as Farnese Hercules in gilt terra cotta .
The refinement of molding techniques made it possible to create true miniature statues , with a high level of detail .
LaocoÃ n , strangled by snakes , tries desperately to loosen their grip without affording a glance at his dying sons .
Many of the large bronze statues were lost â '' with the majority being melted to recover the material .
At Panagyurishte ( now in Bulgaria ) , skillfully sculpted gold vases have been found : on an amphora , two rearing centaurs form the handles .
The drunk woman , also at Munich , portrays without reservation an old woman , thin , haggard , clutching against herself her jar of wine .
In Derveni , not far from Salonica , a tomb has provided a great krater with bronze volutes dating from approximately 320 BC and weighing 40 kilograms ( Derveni krater ) .
Portraiture is tinged with naturalism , under the influence of Roman art .
This type of retrospective style also exists in ceramics .
Pergamon in particular is a characteristic example of Hellenistic architecture .
As compensation , the cameo made its appearance .
These characteristics are pushed to their peak in the friezes of the Great Altar of Pergamon , decorated under the order of Eumenes II ( 197 159 BC ) with a gigantomachy stretching 110 metres in length , illustrating in the stone a poem composed especially for the court .
A colossal theater , able to contain nearly 10,000 spectators , has benches embedded in the flanks of the hill .
The figures , often female , are represented in colored clothing : blue violet chiton , yellow himation , white veil .
It was in the Hellenistic period that the Greeks , who until then only knew molded glass , discovered the technique of glass blowing , thus permitting new forms .
Or they could simply be caricatures , designed to provoke laughter .
They represented divinities as well as subjects from contemporary life .
Thus , Venus de Milo , even while echoing a classic model , is distinguished by the twist of her hips .
The expression of sentiments , the forcefulness of details â '' bushy hair and moustaches here â '' and the violence of the movements are characteristic of the Pergamene style .
The Hellenistic period is that of the decline of painting on vases .
One finds also more complex relief , based on animals or mythological creatures .
Thus emerged the theme of the `` negro '' , particularly in Ptolemaic Egypt : these statuettes of Black adolescents were successful up to the Roman period .
The most common vases are black and uniform , with a shiny appearance approaching that of varnish , decorated with simple motifs of flowers or festoons .
In this period the insetting of precious stones flourished .
It is also the period when vases in relief appeared , doubtless in imitation of vases made of precious metals : wreaths in relief were applied to the body of the vase , or again the one shown here received veins or gadroons .
Hellenistic sculpture repeats the innovations of the `` second classicism '' : perfect sculpture in the round , allowing the statue to be admired from all angles ; study of draping and effects of transparency of clothing ; suppleness of poses .
It has long been necessary to content oneself with studying the Hellenistic influences in Roman frescoes , for example those of Pompeii or Herculaneum .
Progress in bronze casting made it possible for the Greeks to create large works , such as the Colossus of Rhodes , with a height of 32 meters .

In qualifying , Senna and Chandhok set the 23rd and 24th quickest times to share the back row of the starting grid : Chandhok was finally able to complete his car 's first laps in anger and set a time 1.7 seconds slower than his team mate , who was in turn just over eight seconds behind polesitter Sebastian Vettel .
By contrast , the mechanics were unable to make the clutch and gearbox on Chandhok 's car work , and he did not complete any laps on Friday .
The team 's headquarters were originally located at Meta Images 's offices in Madrid , housing marketing and administration , while its technical center is located at Campos Racing 's headquarters in Alzira , Valencia .

Season in progress .
For the race , both cars started from the pit lane ; Chandhok crashed out on the second lap and Senna retired on lap 18 with an overheating engine .
He also denied the fact that F1 hopefuls Stefan GP had taken the Campos ' car stating that `` we 've got a contract and as long as we 're paying the contract is valid '' .
Later in February , speculation began to spread as to whether Campos would actually make the 2010 field , and the team admitted budgetary problems .
Italian constructor Dallara built the 2010 cars in Parma , which used Cosworth engines .
Campos was running the Formula One operation in conjunction with Meta Image , a Madrid based sports agency , who managed one of Campos ' F3 Open drivers at the time , Bruno MÃ ndez .
However , it was announced that Senna would race after Silverstone , saying that they `` want to confirm that Bruno Senna has all the support of the Spanish team '' and `` that he remains one of the Hispania Racing HRT F1 team 's official drivers and that he will be continuing to drive in the remaining races . ''
Senna described the day 's work as a `` great start '' , considering the team 's lack of preparation .

Parasitic wasps are typically parasitoids , and extremely diverse in habits , many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host ( egg or pupa ) , or sometimes paralyzing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor .
Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they prey mostly on pest insects and have little impact on crops .
With most species , adult parasitic wasps themselves do not take any nutrients from their prey , and , much like bees , butterflies , and moths , those that do feed as adults typically derive all of their nutrition from nectar .
The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae are mature , usually dying either when the parasitoids pupate , or when they emerge as adults .
They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the host externally .
Almost every pest insect species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it , making wasps critically important in natural control of their numbers , or natural biocontrol .
The various species of wasps fall into one of two main categories : solitary wasps and social wasps .

Ashes of broom were used to treat dropsy , while its strong smell was said to be able to tame wild horses and dogs .
Brooms are a group of evergreen , semi evergreen , and deciduous shrubs in the subfamily Faboideae of the legume family Fabaceae , mainly in the three genera Chamaecytisus , Cytisus and Genista , but also in five other small genera ( see box , right ) .
All genera in this group are from the tribe Genisteae .
These genera are all closely related and share similar characteristics of dense , slender green stems and very small leaves , which are adaptations to dry growing conditions .
Like most brooms , it has apparently leafless stems that in spring and summer are covered in profuse golden yellow flowers .
In late summer , its peapod like seed capsules burst open , often with an audible pop , spreading seed from the parent plant .
Many brooms ( though not all ) are fire climax species , adapted to regular stand replacing fires which kill the above ground parts of the plants , but create conditions for regrowth from the roots and also for germination of stored seeds in the soil .
Despite this , it was also common to include a decorated bundle of broom at weddings .
All the brooms and their relatives ( including Laburnum and Ulex ) are natives of Europe , north Africa and southwest Asia , with the greatest diversity in the Mediterranean region .
