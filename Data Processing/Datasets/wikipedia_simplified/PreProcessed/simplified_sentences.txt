The first Temple of Jupiter was still waiting to be fixed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 , burying the town of Pompeii under lava and ash .
As the most important god in Ancient Rome , many temples were built to honor Jupiter or the entire Capitoline Triad ( a group of three gods that included Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva ) in towns newly taken over by the Romans .
It was still allowed to mostly run itself , however , until the Italic Revolt against Rome at the beginning of the 1st century BC .
The temple had been built in 150 BC to be a very noticeable part of the forum , and it became Pompeii 's main temple after Rome took over .
Pompeii was taken over by the Romans beginning in 310 BC .
This was also true for Pompeii , where the Temple of Jupiter that was already there was enlarged and made more Roman when the Romans took over .
The hollow temple can still be seen in Pompeii today .
In 62 an earthquake shook the city of Pompeii , destroying much of the Temple of Jupiter .
The inside of the temple housed the main room of the temple , which held the statues of Jupiter , Juno , and Minerva , and which only the priests were allowed to enter .
Pompeii was changed into a much more public and open place .
The building style of the town was largely borrowed from the Greeks , but Roman rule would soon lead to changes in this style .
Jupiter was the ruler of the gods and the protector of Rome , where his temple was the center of Roman Religion and of the cult of state .

Public buildings and spaces would eventually be able to be found all over the city .

The identification of `` Lamarckism '' with the inheritance of acquired characteristics alone is regarded by some as an over simplification , rehashed in textbooks repeatedly .
Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists `` re read Lamarck , cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics â `` inheritance of acquired characters â `` to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself '' .
Gould advocated defining `` Lamarckism '' more broadly , in line with Lamarck 's overall evolutionary theory .
He argued that `` the restriction of Lamarckism to this relatively small and non distinctive corner of Lamarck 's thought must be labeled as more than a misnomer , and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system '' .
On the contrary , Lamarck 's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution .

These are ossified ( turned into bone ) portions of cartilage called Meckel 's cartilage that are attached to the jaw .
These correspond to the quadrate , prearticular , articular , and angular structures in earlier land vertebrates .
The structure is known as the middle ear , and is made up of the incus , stapes , malleus , and tympanic membrane .
Studies have shown that ear bones in mammal embryos are attached to the dentary , which is part of the lower jaw .
Later in development , the bone structure breaks loose from the jaw and migrates to the inner ear area .
The terms mean hammer , anvil , and stirrup .
The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate to severe hearing loss .
The ossicles are the three smallest bones in the human body .
As the embryo develops , the cartilage hardens to form bone .
They may be called ear bones or auditory ossicles .

If the growth rate is known , the maximum lichen size will give a minimum age for when this rock was deposited .
Map lichen is a lichen widely used by climatologists to determine the relative age of deposits .
Growth rates for different areas and species can be obtained by measuring maximum lichen sizes on substrates of known age , such as gravestones , historic or prehistoric rock buildings , or moraines of known age ( e.g those deposited during the Little Ice Age ) .
Lichenometry is based on the assumption that the largest lichen growing on a rock is the oldest individual .
These patches grow next to each other . This makes the lichen look like a map or a patchwork field .
The map lichen is a species of lichen , Rhizocarpon geographicum . It grows on rocks in areas of low air pollution .
The process is called lichenometry .

Any problem that is in NP can be changed so that to the Boolean satisfiability theorem . On a deterministic Turing machine this takes polynomial time .
An important consequence of the theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability , then there exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for solving all problems in NP .
The question of whether such an algorithm exists is called the P versus NP problem and it is widely considered the most important unsolved problem in theoretical computer science .

Anoxic events occur when the Earth 's oceans become completely depleted of oxygen ( O2 ) below the surface levels .
Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years , the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past .
There are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level .
` Dead zones ' exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay , in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat , the Black Sea , in the northern Adriatic and off the coast of Louisiana .
It is believed oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to climate warming and greenhouse gases .
They may be called Oceanic anoxic events or Deep ocean anoxic events .
Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions .
Typically , oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years , before a full recovery .
These mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphic dating .

They showed the chert was indeed produced by a hot spring setting . Cores were drilled in 1988 and 1997 .
The chert was formed when silica rich water from volcanic springs rose and rapidly petrified the early terrestrial ecosystem in situ . Organisms are petrified that way by hot springs today , although that quality of preservation has not been found in recent deposits .
The chert is exposed near the village of Rhynie , Aberdeenshire , Scotland . A second unit , the Windyfield chert , is located some 700 m away .
Hot springs , with temperatures between 90 t , were active ; the water had probably cooled to under 30 C before it reached the fossilised organisms .
The chert was discovered by William Mackie while mapping the western margin of the Rhynie basin in 1910 â `` 1913 .
The deposits are interbedded with sands , shales and tuffs , which speaks of local volcanic activity .
Deposition was very rapid .

It was early days Moog work and it did take a bit of time '' .
I 've got some thoughts on this one . '

I do n't know why it was silver , it just sounded better than Maxwell 's hammer .
Paul McCartney said : `` The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on Maxwell 's Silver Hammer .
John Lennon later said , `` I hate it ... He did everything to make it into a single , and it never was and it never could have been . ''
It just so happens in this batch of songs I would look at these subjects and thought it was good for writing .
In 1977 Harrison was more candid , describing it as `` so fruity '' but added `` we did a good job on it '' .
After resuming to record the Abbey Road album , the Beatles began recording Maxwell 's Silver Hammer at Abbey Road Studios on July 9 , 1969 .

George Harrison described it in 1969 as `` one of those instant whistle along tunes which some people hate , and other people really like .
`` Maxwell 's Silver Hammer '' is a song by The Beatles , from the Abbey Road album , with Paul McCartney singing lead .
I wanted something symbolic of that , so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer .
If it 's good enough to take to your psychiatrist , it 's good enough to make a song of . ''
It was needed for scanning .
McCartney , Harrison and Starr taped 16 takes of the song , followed by a series of guitar overdubs .
It 's a fun song , but it 's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher , and then , finally , the judge . ''

Ferdinand attempted to retain the regency permanently , but was rebuffed by the Castilian nobility and replaced with Joanna 's husband , who became Philip I of Castile .
The succession of his grandson Charles , who inherited not only the Spanish lands of his maternal grandparents , but the Habsburg and Burgundian lands of his paternal family , would make his heirs the most powerful rulers on the continent .
Instead , the Holy League was formed , in which all the powers now joined together against France .
In November 1511 Ferdinand and his son in law Henry VIII of England signed the Treaty of Westminster , pledging mutual aid between the two against France .
After Philip 's death in 1506 , with Joanna mentally unstable , and her and Philip 's son Charles of Ghent only six years old , Ferdinand resumed the regency , ruling through Francisco Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros , the Chancellor of the Kingdom .

The French were successful in reconquering Milan two years later , however .
In 1508 , war resumed in Italy , this time against Venice . All the other powers on the peninsula , including Louis XII , Ferdinand , Maximilian , and Pope Julius II joined together against as the League of Cambrai .
Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479 and the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union . For the first time since the 8th century this created a single political unit which might be called Spain , although the various territories were not properly administered as a single unit until the 18th century .
Ferdinand II the Catholic ( Spanish : Fernando V de Castilla ) ( March 10 , 1452 â `` June 23 , 1516 ) was king of Aragon ( 1479 1516 ) , Castile , Sicily ( 1468 1516 ) , Naples ( 1504 1516 ) , Valencia , Sardinia and Navarre and Count of Barcelona .
Earlier that year , Ferdinand had conquered the southern half of the Kingdom of Navarre , which was ruled by a French nobleman , and annexed it to Spain .
In 1501 , following the death of Ferdinand II of Naples and his succession by his uncle Frederick , Ferdinand of Aragon signed an agreement with Charles VIII 's successor , Louis XII . Louis had just successfully asserted his claims to the Duchy of Milan , and they agreed to partition Naples between them , with Campania and the Abruzzi , including Naples itself , going to the French and Ferdinand taking Apulia and Calabria .

That plant has a completely different taste . This is because phenolic compounds are missing in its essential oil .
Some breeds show a flavor intermediate between oregano and marjoram .

However , the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes remain unclear '' .
In the mid 1980s , Syvanen predicted that lateral gene transfer existed , had biological significance , and was involved in shaping evolutionary history from the beginning of life on Earth .
However , Richardson and Palmer ( 2007 ) state : `` Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes .
Most thinking in genetics has focused on vertical transfer , but there is a growing awareness that horizontal gene transfer is a significant phenomenon . Amongst single celled organisms it may be the dominant form of genetic transfer .
Artificial horizontal gene transfer is a form of genetic engineering .
Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) ( or Lateral gene transfer ) is any process in which an organism gets genetic material from another organism without being the offspring of that organism .
There is some evidence that even higher plants and animals have been affected and this has raised concerns for safety .
By contrast , vertical transfer occurs when an organism gets genetic material from its ancestor , e.g. , its parent or a species from which it has evolved .
Horizontal gene transfer was first described in Japan in a 1959 publication that demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different species of bacteria .
The phenomenon appears to have had some significance for unicellular eukaryotes as well .

Dromornis are part of a family of giant birds called Dromornithidae that lived from 15 million years ago until less than 30,000 years ago .
Dromornis is a genus of fossil flightless birds .
It lived in Australia from the late Miocene to the early Pliocene .
Its legs were powerful , but it was not a fast runner .
D. stirtoni had a long neck and stub like wings , so it was flightless .
However , others have argued that the size of the beak suggests that the bird was a carnivore .
The animals of Australia had evolved very slowly in almost complete isolation from the animals of other continents .
Dromornis stirtoni was three metres ( 10 feet ) tall and weighed up to half a ton ( 500 kilos ) .
Dromornis had a huge beak and jaw capable of great force . It did not have the typical beak and claws of a carnivore , and its life style is not certain .
It inhabited subtropical open woodland in Australia during the late Miocene . It may have been partly carnivorous .

Lorenz began his studies in 1922 at Columbia University , but he returned to Vienna in 1923 to continue his studies at the University of Vienna until 1928 .
Lorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad .
Lorenz predicted that market economics could eventually destroy Earth 's ecosystem .
He arrived back in Altenberg `` with manuscript and bird intact . ''
In his autobiographical essay , published in 1973 in Les Prix Nobel ( people who win the Nobel Prize are asked to write essays about their lives ) , Lorenz said that his parents were the main reason he was so successful . He also said that a book by Selma Lagerlof called The Wonderful Adventures of Nils that he read as a child was the reason he became interested in wild geese .
Lorenz argued that if our senses gave us wrong information about our environment , humanity would soon be extinct .
He tried to become a motorcycle mechanic , but instead he was assigned as a medic .
Lorenz states that humanity is the only species that is not forced to abide by these mechanisms , as humans are the only species that has the ability to change its own environment : '' ( The pace of human ecology ) is determined by the progress of man 's technology '' . Not only that , but human ecology ( economy ) is governed by mechanisms of positive feedback , defined as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to discourage it .
Konrad Lorenz died on 27 February 1989 , in Altenberg .
Another contribution is his work on imprinting .
His scientific work appeared mainly in journal articles , written in German ; they became widely known to English speaking scientists through the descriptions of it in Tinbergen 's 1951 book The Study of Instinct , though many of his papers were later published in English translation in the two volumes titled Studies in Animal and Human Behavior .
The manuscript became his book Behind the Mirror .
Lorenz shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine `` for discoveries in individual and social behavior patterns '' with two other important early ethologists , Niko Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch .
When he was sent back home after the war , he was allowed to keep both the manuscript of the book he had been writing and his pet starling .
His influence on a younger generation of ethologists , as well as his books , were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public .
Lorenz joined the Nazi Party in 1938 and accepted a university position under Nazi Germany .
`` To gain a desired prey , a dog or wolf will do things ( that they would normally not do , such as ) run through thorn bushes , jump into cold water and expose themselves to risks which would normally frighten them .
In 1940 Lorenz became a professor of psychology at the University of KÃ nigsberg .
Lorenz ' answer comes from evolutionary biology .
Konrad Zacharias Lorenz ( Vienna , 7 November 1903 Vienna , 27 February 1989 ) was an Austrian zoologist , naturalist , ornithologist and Nobel Prize winner .
All these inhibitory mechanisms ... act as a counterweight to the effects of learning mechanisms ... The organism can not allow itself to pay a price which is not worth paying '' .
In 1969 , he became the first person to receive the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca .
Together with Niko Tinbergen , Lorenz formed the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors ( fixed action patterns ) .
Lorenz 's best known books are King Solomon 's Ring ( nonfiction ) King Solomon 's Ring and On Aggression , both written for a popular audience .
In this book , Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth .
At this university he became an assistant professor from 1928 to 1935 .
He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941 .
Only things that help a species to survive and reproduce are kept .
Therefore we can be sure that our senses give us correct information , for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived .
He was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from 1942 to 1948 .
It is obvious that the predator is strongly interested in the survival of that species , animal or vegetable , which constitutes its prey .
During this time , he continued to work as a medical doctor and `` got quite friendly with some Russians , mostly doctors '' .
Building on the ideas of William McDougall , Lorenz developed this into a `` psychohydraulic '' explanation of the motives ( reasons ) of behavior .
... It is not uncommon that the prey species derives specific benefits from its interaction with the predator species ... '' .
In his application for membership to the Nazi party NSDAP he wrote in 1938 : `` I 'm able to say that my whole scientific work is devoted to the ideas of the National Socialists . ''
In his 1973 book Behind the Mirror : a search for a natural history of human knowledge , Lorenz considers an old philosophical question : Do our senses actually tell us about the world as it is ? Or do they only give us an illusion ?
Lorenz studied instinctive behavior in animals , especially in Greylag geese and jackdaws .
However , the principle of competition , typical of Western societies , destroys any chance of this : `` The competition between human beings destroys with cold and diabolic brutality ... Under the pressure of this competitive fury we have not only forgotten what is useful to humanity as a whole , but even that which is good and advantageous to the individual .
Indeed , he states that `` a completely new ( ecology ) which corresponds in every way to ( humanity 's ) desires ... could , theoretically , prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention '' p36 .
In nature , these mechanisms tend towards a ` stable state ' among the living beings of an ecology : `` A closer examination shows that these beings ... not only do not damage each other , but often constitute a community of interests .

The term heterodox is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings .
As an adjective , heterodox is used to describe a subject as `` characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards '' ( status quo ) .
Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views , either on doctrinal or social issues .
A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment .
The belief is not orthodox , as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants ; however , it is also not heresy , as the Church accepts that such a scenario might be possible .
The heterodox Christians remain in the tradition and attempt a constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree .
Heterodoxy means a position that is not within the standards of orthodoxy or to put it precisely `` any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position '' .
In the Eastern Orthodox Church , the term is used to refer to Christian churches not belonging to the Eastern Orthodox communion , but have no positions that are as different from those of Orthodox Christianity to thought to be as false as heresy .
For example , the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain , and `` the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God '' ( Catechism of the Catholic Church 1261 ) .
Heterodoxy in the Roman Catholic Church in a similar way means views that differ from strictly orthodox views , but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid heresy .

There is a debate about whaling in general .
Whaling is the practice of hunting whales . This is done to get meat and oil , called blubber .
In the late 1930s more than 50,000 whales were killed each year . By the middle of the 20th century , whale stocks could not recover .
There is a debate about whaling in general . Countries which are in favor of whaling want to do away with the moratorium , so they can again hunt whales as they did before .
In 1986 , the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling so that stocks might recover .
Whaling has been done at least since 3000 BC .
Countries and environmental groups say that whaling is immoral , and that stocks have not yet recovered sufficiently . As whaling is immoral it should be banned .

They taught that according to both the Bible and Christian tradition , alcohol is a gift from God that makes life happier , but that drinking too much of it and becoming drunk is a sin .
Today , all three of these positions are in Christianity , but most people still believe in the traditional position .
In the mid 19th century , some Protestant Christians moved away from this traditional belief that drinking a moderate ( small ) amount of wine was not bad ( sometimes called moderationism ) . They either decided deciding that not drinking wine at all was wisest ( abstentionism ) , or that drinking any alcohol was sinful ( prohibitionism ) .
The languages in the Bible have several words for alcoholic drinks . Though prohibitionists and some abstentionists disagree , most people agree that the words were usually meant to be about intoxicating drinks .
Most Christians ' opinions about alcohol depend on the way they understand what the Bible says about it , so the Bible is an important source about it .
However , the Bible also calls wine a mocker and beer a brawler ( a person who fights too much ) . Drinking a cup of strong wine and getting drunk are also used sometimes as a symbol of God 's anger .
Wine can be used as a symbol for good things , like abundance and health . .

Drogue parachutes are used to aid horizontal deceleration of a vehicle ( a fixed wing aircraft , or a drag racer ) , or to provide stability ( tandem free fall , or space shuttle after touchdown ) .
Only slightly later , a more sophisticated parachute was sketched by the polymath Leonardo da Vinci in his Codex Atlanticus ( fol .
Reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently .
Exact numbers are difficult to estimate , but approximately one in a thousand sports main parachute openings malfunction , and must be cut away , although some skydivers have many hundreds of jumps and never cut away .
( 5 ) According to the historian of technology Lynn White , these conical and pyramidal designs , much more elaborate than early artistic jumps with rigid parasols in Asia , mark the origin of `` the parachute as we know it '' .
( 4 ) The feasibility of Leonardo 's pyramidal design was successfully tested in 2000 by the British Adrian Nicholas and again in 2008 by another skydiver .
If a parachute is not packed properly it can result in death because the main parachute might fail to deploy correctly or fully .
Parachutes can malfunction in several ways .
Sport skydivers are always trained to pack their own primary `` main '' parachutes .
In the U.S. and many developed countries , emergency and reserve parachutes are packed by `` riggers '' who must be trained and certified according to legal standards .
Leonardo 's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame , which alters the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal .
In the U.S. , the average fatality rate is considered to be about 1 in 80,000 jumps .
This yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction , although the possibility of a main malfunction that can not be cut away causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk .
Most skydivers also equip themselves with small barometric computers ( known as an AAD or automatic activation device like Cypres , FXC or Vigil ) that will automatically activate the reserve parachute if the skydiver himself has not deployed a parachute to reduce his rate of descent by a preset altitude .
They are also designed more conservatively , and are built and tested to more exacting standards , making them more reliable than main parachutes .

In the negative connotation , compromise may be referred to as capitulation , referring to a `` surrender '' of objectives , principles , or material , in the process of negotiating an agreement .
To compromise is to make a deal where one person gives up part of his or her demand .
In human relationships , `` compromise '' is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with , this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little .
Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system .
Research has indicated that less than optimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party , and hence , they settle for suboptimal agreements .
Extremism is often considered as antonym to compromise , which , depending on context , may be associated with concepts of balance or tolerance .
Mutually better outcomes can often be found by careful study of both parties ' interests , especially if done early in negotiations .

A spatula , also called a turner , or a fish slice , is a kitchen tool with a long handle and a flat top , used for lifting food .
Spatulas are usually made of plastic or metal , with a wooden or plastic handle to keep it away from heat .
This is particularly visible in snakes , which are able to open their mouths very wide to accommodate comparatively large prey .
The squamates and tuatara together are a sister group to crocodiles and birds , the living archosaurs .
From morphological data , Iguanid lizards have been thought to have diverged from other squamates very early , but recent molecular phylogenies , both from mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , do not support this early divergence .
Squamates are a monophyletic group that is a sister group to the tuatara .
Snake venom evolved by the duplication of a gene encoding for a normal regulatory or bioactivity protein . Then the copy was expressed in the venom gland .
Natural selection has driven the diversification of the toxins to counter the defences of the prey .
Venom in the families Caenophidia , Anguimorpha , and Iguania evolved once , then the three families diverged . All three lineages share nine common toxins .
Venom genes form large multigene families , and evolve by protein evolution . This leads to a diversification of toxins that let sit and wait predators attack a wide range of prey .
Their skins have overlapping horny scales .
Recent research suggests that the evolutionary origin of venom lies deep in the squamate phylogeny . 60 % of squamates are venomous Toxicofera .
They are the most variably sized order of reptiles , ranging from the 16 mm ( 0.63 in . )
Squamate fossils first appear in the early Jurassic , but a mitochondrial phylogeny suggests that they evolved in the late Permian .
The evolutionary relationships within the squamates are not yet completely worked out , with the relationship of snakes to other groups being most problematic .
Of these , the lizards form a paraphyletic group .
They also have movable quadrate bones , which make it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase .
Because snakes have a faster molecular clock than other squamates , and there are few early snake and snake ancestor fossils , it is difficult to resolve the relationship between snakes and other squamate groups .
In newer classifications the name Sauria is used for reptiles and birds in general , and the Squamata are divided differently :

It is strange that Hitler went to performances in Bayreuth that included Jewish and foreign singers , long after they had been banned from performing in all other places in Germany .
After Wagner 's death , his widow Cosima continued to run the festival .
Winifred 's influence with Hitler was so strong that Hitler even wrote a letter to the anti fascist Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini , begging him to lead the festival .
A lot of important people were there , including Kaiser Wilhelm , Dom Pedro II of Brazil , King Ludwig ( who came in secret , perhaps because he did not want to meet the Kaiser ) , and other members of the nobility , as well as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , and the composers Anton Bruckner , Edvard Grieg , Pyotr Tchaikovsky , and Franz Liszt .
After the war , Winifred Wagner was sentenced to probation by a war court because she had supported the Nazi party .
In the 1920s , some years before the rise of the Nazi party , Winifred Wagner became a close friend of Adolf Hitler .
After Cosima retired from running the festival in 1906 , Wagner 's son Siegfried took over management of the festival . He did some things differently , introducing new staging and performance styles .
The Bayreuth Festival is a music festival held every year in Bayreuth , Germany , at which performances of operas by the 19th century German composer Richard Wagner are performed .

During the war , the Nazi party ran the festival . Operas were performed for soldiers who had been hurt in the fighting .
Toscanini refused .
These soldiers were forced to go to lectures on Wagner before the performances , even if they were not interested in music .
She gradually introduced the other operas Wagner had written , so that all ten operas were in the repertoire .
Wagner 's works were used by the Nazi as propaganda tools .
The opening took place on August 13 , 1876 , with a performance of Das Rheingold .

Since 1990 , household income has fallen slightly , but this does not take into account the decrease in average household size .
Thus , while married couple households with children are the most economically prosperous type of household in the United States , their share of the population has been dwindeling in the United States .
Unlike the median household income which divides all households in two halves , the mean income is the average income earned by American households .
While median household income has tendency to increase up to four persons per household , it declines thereon after .
Overall households headed by Hispanics and African Americans or Blacks were underrepresented in the top two quintiles and overrepresented in the bottom two quintiles .
The median income per member of household for this particular group was $ 27,924 .
In 2004 the median household income in the United States was $ 43,389 .
The highest income households are almost ten times as likely to own their homes rather than rent , but in the lowest quintile , the ratio of owners to renters is nearly one to one .
The median income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income .
The median household income rose by 30 % while the income for the 20th percentile ( the lower threshold for the second lowest quitile ) rose by only 28 % from $ 14,002 to $ 17,984 .
In the case of mean income , the income of all households is divided by the number of all households .
Those with doctorates had the second highest median household with a median of $ 96,830 ; $ 18,289 more higher than that for those at the Master 's degree level , but $ 3,170 lower than the median for households with a professionals degree holding householder .
Cross referencing shows that this is likely due to the presence of multiple income earners in these families .
Married couples are disproportionately represented in the upper two quintiles , compared to the general population of households .
These figures support the general assumption that median household income as well as the median income per member of household peaked among those households headed by middle aged persons , increasing with the age of the householder and the size of the household until the householder reaches the age of 64 .
Household type is strongly correlated with household income .
Household income as well as per capita income in the United States rise significantly as the educational attainment increases .
Considering other racial and geographical inequities in regards to household income , it should come as no surprise that the median household income varies with race , size of household and geography .
Overall , the median household income rose from $ 33,338 in 1967 to an all time high of $ 44,922 in 1999 , and has since decreased slightly to $ 43,318 .
In 1972 , disposable personal income was determined to be $ 4,129 ; $ 19,385 in 2005 dollars .
Between 1999 and 2004 household income stagnated showing a slight increase since 2004 .
Households headed by single males are disproportionately found in the middle three quintles ; single females head households concentrated in the bottom three quintiles .
The southern states had the by far lowest median household income with nine out of the country 's fifteen poorest states being located in the South .
The residents of the household do not have to be related to the householder for their earnings to be considered part of the household 's income .
While educational attainment did not help reduce the income inequality between men and women , it did increase the earnings potential of individuals of both sexes , greatly enabling many households with ( a ) graduate degree householder ( s ) to enter the top household income quintile .
In 1990 , the median household income was determined to be $ 30,056 ; $ 44,603 in 2003 dollars .
In 1969 , more than 40 % of all households consisted of a married couple with children .
Households in the mid quintile , with a mean of one income earner per household had incomes between $ 36,000 and 57,657 .
While California 's median income was not near enough to afford the average California home or even a starter home , West Virginia , which had the nation 's lowest median household income also had the nation 's lowest median home price .
According to the US Census Bureau 2004 Community Survey , two person households had a median income of $ 39,755 , with $ 48,957 for three person households , $ 54,338 for four person households , $ 50,905 for five person households , $ 45,435 for six person households , with seven or more person households having the second lowest median income of only $ 42,471 . .
Yet , it is important to note that income in the period between 1967 and 1999 grew faster among wealthier households than it did among poorer households .
Year round full time workers with a Professional degree had an average income of $ 109,600 while those with a Master 's degree had an average income of $ 62,300 .
California which had the highest median home price in the nation . where home prices have far outpaced incomes only ranked number thirteen with a median household income of $ 49,894 .
It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class , lower middle class , middle class , upper middle class , and upper class .
Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income . Unlike the median household income which divides all households in two halves , the mean income is the average income earned by American households .
Higher educational attainment did not , however , help close the income gap between the genders as the life time earnings for a male with a professionals degree were roughly forty percent ( 39.59 % ) higher than those of a female with a professionals degree .
Please note that all figures are presented in 2003 dollars .
Households are often divided into quintiles according to their gross income .
With retirement income replacing salaries and the size of the household declining , the median household income decreases as well .
In 2005 graduates with a Master 's in Business Administration ( MBA ) who accepted job offers are expected to earn a base salary of $ 88,626 .
The New York Times has used the quintiles to define class .
The change in median personal and household since 1991 also varied greatly with educational attainment .
Not surprisingly the lowest income group was mainly comprised of those households headed by individuals younger than 24 , followed by those headed by persons over the age of 75 .
Decreases in household income are visible during each recession , while increases are visible during economic upturns .
Overall the United States followed the trend of other developed nations with a relatively large population of relatively rich households outnumbering the poor .
The following table shows the median household income according to the educational attainment of the householder .
Households headed by persons who identified as being Asian alone , on the other hand , were overrepresented among the top two quintiles .
As a result the mean tends to be higher as the median income with the top earning households boosting it .
Considering how education significantly enhances the earnings potential of individuals , it should come as no surprise that individuals with graduate degrees have an average per capita income exceeding the median household income of married couple families among the general population ( $ 63,813 ) .
The highest median income per member of household was among those between the ages of 54 and 64 with $ 30,544 .
Despite great advances made to lift minorities out of poverty and many African Americans and Latino Americans joining the middle class , there is still an uneven racial distribution among the income quintiles .
Even though personal income has risen substantially and 42 % of all household now have two income earners , the median household income has increased only slightly .
Households headed by persons between the ages of 45 and 54 had a median household income of $ 61,111 and a mean household income of $ 77,634 .
The 2005 economic survey also found that households in the top two income quintiles , those with an annual household income exceeding $ 55,331 , had a median of two income earners while those in the lower quintiles ( 2nd and middle quintile ) had median of only one income earner per household .
Household income also increased significantly with the educational attainment of the householder .
Household income in the United States varies substantially with the age of the person who heads the household .
Among those in between the relative extremes of the income strata a large and quite powerful section of households with moderately high middle class incomes and an even larger number of households with moderately low incomes .
As a result of these changing household demographics , median household income rose only slighly despite an ever increasing female labor force and a considerable increase in the percentage of college graduates .
All data is in 2003 dollars and only applies to householders whose householder is aged twenty five or older .
While the median household income has increased 44 % since 1990 it has decreased very slightly when considering inflation .
The highest median household income was found among households headed by working baby boomers .
The median income divides households in the US evenly in the middle with half of all household earning more than the median income and half of all households earning less than the median household income . In 2004 the median household income in the United States was $ 43,389 .
In 2005 , disposable personal income was , however , $ 27,640 , showing a moderate 43 % increase .
The median income per household member ( including all working and non working members above the age of 14 ) in the year 2003 was $ 23,535 .
Non family households ( individuals ) are disproportionately represented in the lower two quintiles .
Only 4.75 % of all household in the top 5 % were headed by someone who identified him or herself as being Hispanic or Latino of any race , versus 12.5 % of persons identifying themselves as Hispanic or Latino in the general population .
They are also expected to receive '' â ( a ) n average signing bonus of $ 17,428 . ''
Another common measurement of personal income is the mean household income .
The life time earnings gap between males and females was the smallest for those individuals holding an Associate degrees with male life time earnings being 27.77 % higher than those of females .
While personal income has remained relatively stagnant since over the past few decades , household income has risen due to the rising percentage of households with two or more income earners .
The US Census Bureau publishes educational attainment and income data for all households with a householder who was aged twenty five or older .
17.23 % of all households had annual incomes exceeding $ 100,000 , while another 12.7 % fell below the federal poverty threshold while the bottom 20 % earned less than $ 19,178 .
According to the US Census Bureau persons with doctorates in the United States had an average income of roughly $ 81,400 .
African American or Black households had the lowest median household income of all races with $ 30,134 .
While the use of household income remains among the most widely accepted as households tend to share a common economic fate , the size of a household which is commonly not considered may off set gains in household income .
The group with the second highest median household income , were households headed by persons between the ages 35 and 44 with a median income of $ 56,785 , followed by those in the age group between 55 and 64 with $ 50,400 .
This indicated that while four person households have larger incomes than those with one , two or three members , household with seem to earn progressively less as their size increases beyond four persons .
While the aggregate income distribution tends to tilt towards the top with the top 6.37 % earning roughly one third of all income , those with upper middle incomes also controlled a large , though declining , share of the total earned income .
The biggest income difference was between those with some college education and those who had a Bachelor 's degree , with the latter making $ 23,874 more .
Median household income in the Mid West declined by 2.8 % to $ 44,657 .
The average for an advanced degree was $ 72,824 with men averaging $ 90,761 and women averaging $ 50,756 annually .
Income also increased substantially with increased post secondary education .
These fluctuations were felt across the income strata as the incomes of both , the 95th and 20th percentile were affected by flactuations in the economy .
Overall the median household income increased with the age of householder until retirement age when household income started to decline .
While the median household income for a household with a household holding an Associates degree was $ 51,970 , the median household income for those with a Bachelor 's degree or higher was $ 73,446 .
Since 1967 , the median household income in the United States has risen modestly , fluctuating several times .

Overall the mean household income in the United States according to the US Census Bureau 2004 Economic Survey was $ 60,528 , or $ 17,210 ( 39.73 % ) higher than the median household income .
In terms of region the median household income was as follows : `` Northeast ( $ 47,994 ) , West ( $ 47,680 ) and South ( $ 40,773 ) . ''
By 1996 only a rough quarter of US households consisted of married couples with children .
While White American who were not of Hispanic descent made up roughly 75.1 % of all persons in 2000 , 87.93 % of all households in the top 5 % were headed by a person who identified as being White alone .
Overall 86.01 % of all households in the top two quintiles with upper middle range incomes of over $ 55,331 were headed by a head of household who identified him or herself as White alone , while only 7.21 % were being headed by someone who identified as being Hispanic and 7.37 % by someone who idenitified as being African American or Black .
The mean income is usually more affected by the relatively unequal distribution of income which tilts towards the top .
In the top five percent the percentage of Asians was nearly twice as high as the percentage of Asians among the general population .
To measure the income of a household , the pre tax money receipts of all residents over the age of 15 are combined . Most of these receipts are in the form of wages and salaries ( before withholding and other taxes ) , but many other forms of income , such as unemployment insurance , disability , child support , etc. , are included as well .
Overall households headed by persons above the age of seventy five had a median household income of $ 20,467 with the median household income per member of household being $ 18,645 .
Households in the top quintile , 77 % of which had two income earners , had incomes exceeding $ 91,705 .
In terms of race , Asian Americans households had the highest median household income of $ 57,518 , European American households ranked second with $ 48,977 , Hispanic or Latino households ranked third with $ 34,241 .
For example the household income for the 80th precentile , the lower threshold for the top quintile , rose from $ 55,265 in 1967 to $ 86,867 in 2003 , a 57.2 % increase .
Each quintile represents 20 % , or one fifth , of the population .
While per capita , disposable income has increased 469 % since 1972 it has only increased moderately when considering inflation .
For example , while the proportion of wives working year round in married couple households with children has increased from 17 % in 1967 to 39 % in 1996 , the proportion of such households among the general population has decreased .
European Americans were relatively even distributed throughout the quintiles only being underrepresented in the lowest quintile and slightly overrepresented in the top quintile and the top five percent .
The highest and lowest points of the median household income are presented in bold face .
One should note that ht majority of households in the top quintile had two income earners , versus zero for the lowest quintile and that the widening gap between the top and lowest quintile may largely be the reflection of changing household demographics including the addition of women to the workforce .

Single or double quotation marks show the text as meaning either speech or a quotation .
Regardless of its placement , only one end mark ( ?
The two may , however , in these cases , be to some degree interchangeable .
Nesting levels up to five can be found in the Bible .
When available , however , the prime should be used instead ( e. g. , 5 â 6 â , and 40 Â 20 â 50 â ) .
When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text , a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence , such as a colon or closing punctuation .
The important rule is that the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched :
â HAL said , `` Good morning , Dave , '' â â recalled Frank .
When quoted text is interrupted , such as with the phrase he said , a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption , and an opening quotation mark after .
As noted below , in some older texts , the quotation mark is repeated every line , rather than every paragraph .
â HAL , â noted Frank , â said that everything was going extremely well .
In these cases , questions arise about the form ( and names ) of the quotation marks to be used .
Quotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century , and were used copiously by some printers by the seventeenth .
In some languages , if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string , the quotation marks are doubled .
Quotation marks are used for multiple paragraph quotations in some cases , especially in narratives .
It is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech .
The logic , for this form , derives from the need to distinguish use forms , coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms .
Other languages use an escape character , often the backslash , as in ` eat ` hot ' dogs ' .
These three characters have quite different purposes , however .
In Early Modern English , quotation marks were used only to denote pithy comments .
In the first centuries of typesetting , quotations were distinguished merely by indicating the speaker , and this can still be seen in some editions of the Bible .
Quotation marks or inverted commas ( informally known as quotes and speech marks ) are punctuation marks used in pairs to set off speech , a quotation , a phrase , or a word .
This usage can be confused with ironic or altered usage quotation , sometimes with unintended humor .
For instance , 5 feet and 6 inches is often written 5 ' 6 '' , and 40 degrees , 20 arcminutes , and 50 arcseconds is written 40 Â 20 ' 50 '' .
Neither style single or double is an absolute rule , though double quotation marks are preferred in the United States , and both single and double quotation marks are used often in the United Kingdom .
Yes , he did say , â He said , â Good morning .

Straight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters .
Long quotations were also set this way , at full size and full measure .
When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other , proper spacing for legibility requires that a non breaking space be inserted .
Cheese is derived from milk .
They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes .
`` HAL said , â Good morning , Dave , â â '' recalled Frank .
As a rule , a whole publication would be italicised , whereas the titles of minor works ( such as poems or short stories inside the collection ) would be written with quotation marks .
When this practice was abandoned , the empty margin remained , leaving the modern form of indented block quotation .
Incorrect : HAL said that â Everything was going extremely well .
Quotation marks , rather than italics , are generally used for the titles of shorter works .
There is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word , or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word .
The convention in English is to put an opening quotation mark at the first and each subsequent paragraph , but use a closing quotation mark only for the final paragraph of the quotation , as in the following example from the book Pride and Prejudice :
If such a passage is further quoted in another publication , then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level .
During the Renaissance , quotations were distinguished by setting in a typeface contrasting with the main body text ( often Italic type with roman , or the other way round ) .
To avoid the potential for confusion between ironic quotes and direct quotations , some style guides specify single quotation marks for this usage , and double quotation marks for verbatim speech .
In some Baroque and Romantic period books , they would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation .
The lunch lady plopped a glob of `` food '' onto my tray .
The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity .
Some implementations incorrectly produce an opening single quotation mark in places where an apostrophe is required , for example , in abbreviated years like â 08 for 2008 .
The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms , thus :
In English , when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text , a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol , such as a dash , requires that there be no space .
Commas are also often used before and after the interruption , more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text :
This style of punctuation is common in the U.S. , Canada , and in the U.K. in fiction and journalism .
By 1749 single quotation marks , or inverted commas , were commonly used to denote direct speech .
Quotes indicating irony , or other special use , are sometimes called scare , sneer , shock , distance , or horror quotes .
They first began to quote direct speech in 1714 .
They differ on the treatment of periods and commas .
Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style ; however , many styles , especially for poetry , prefer the use of single quotation marks .
Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts ( one such example being YouTube ) .
Quotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense .
`` Good morning , Frank , '' said HAL .
With regard to quotation marks adjacent to periods and commas , there are two styles of punctuation in widespread use .
In all major forms of English , question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside or outside quoted material depending on whether they apply to the whole sentence or just the quoted portion , but colons and semicolons are always placed outside .
Crystals somehow `` know '' which shape to grow into .
He shared his `` wisdom '' with me .
For example , For sale : `` fresh '' fish , `` fresh '' oysters , could be construed to imply that fresh is not used with its everyday meaning , or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh .
In some languages ( e. g. Pascal ) only one type is allowed , in some ( e. g. C and its derivatives ) both are used with different meanings and in others ( e. g. Python ) both are used interchangeably .
Cheese has calcium , protein , and phosphorus .
Only the period , however , can not end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the enclosing sentence , except for literal text :
Straight quotation marks ( or italicized straight quotation marks ) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime , e. g. , when signifying feet and inches , arcminutes and arcseconds or minutes and seconds , where the quotation mark symbolises the latter part of the pair .

This is because a paraphrase is not a direct quote , and in the course of any composition , it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea .
The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe , and similar to the prime symbol .
Quotes are sometimes used incorrectly for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics , most commonly on signs or placards .
The Chicago Manual of Style ( CMS ) , 15th edition acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 7.58 , â Quotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard , ironic , or other special sense ( â ) They imply â This is not my term , â or â This is not how the term is usually applied .
â Correct : HAL said that everything was going extremely well .
In most cases , quotations which span multiple paragraphs should be set as block quotations , and thus do not require quotation marks .
â Good morning , Frank , â said HAL .

When dealing with direct speech , American rules place periods and commas inside the quotation marks all the time , but the alternative usage varies .
The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first .
Using either quotation marks or italics can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself , rather than its associated concept .
Sometimes , quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation .

The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been known since prehistoric times , and used to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding .
Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity , Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via discrete units of inheritance , which are now called genes .
However , the modern science of genetics , which seeks to understand the process of inheritance , only began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid nineteenth century .
Geneticists can also use pedigree charts to predict how traits will be passed to future children in a family .

Napoleon remarked the king `` has lost his best minister . ''
Louise 's death left her husband alone during a period of great difficulty , as the Napoleonic Wars and need for reform continued .

Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg Strelitz ( German : Luise Auguste Wilhelmine Amalie Herzogin zu Mecklenburg ; 10 March 1776 19 July 1810 ) was Queen consort of Prussia as the wife of King Frederick William III .
Though Prussia had not fought in a war since 1795 , its military leaders were confident that they could win against Napoleon 's troops .
Prussian troops began mobilizing , culminating in the October 1806 Battle of Jena Auerstedt , which was a disaster for Prussia , as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out .
After a small incident concerning an anti French pamphlet occurred , King Frederick William was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the French emperor .
Before she had called him `` the Monster '' , but now she made a request for a private interview with the emperor . She threw herself at his feet ; Napoleon was impressed by her grace and determination , but he refused to make any concessions .
Queen Louise 's efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression became well admired by future generations .
Napoleon demanded , from a highly superior position , peace terms in what was to be called the Peace of Tilsit ( 1807 ) .
Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit , but only to save `` her Prussia . ''

Like Hollandaise sauce , there are several methods for the preparation of BÃ arnaise sauce .
Alternatively , the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise ( sans lemon juice ) .
Some assume BÃ arnaise refers to the BÃ arn region , a former province now in the dÃ partement of PyrÃ nÃ es Atlantiques , in southwestern Franceto refer to the region of BÃ arn However , the sauce has no tradition in the cooking of the area , and Larousse has the name honoring Henri IV of France , a native of BÃ arn , and for whom the restaurant where the sauce was first shown was named .
BÃ arnaise sauce is often wrongly called Bernaise sauce , as if it were from Bern , the capital city of Switzerland , which is in no way connected with this sauce or its origins .
The most common preparation is a Bain marie method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks .
It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect .
BÃ arnaise is a traditional sauce for steak .
A BÃ arnaise sauce is simply clarified butter , an egg yolk , a shallot , a little tarragon vinegar .
Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine , vinegar , shallots , fresh chervil , fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns ( later strained out ) , with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice .
Others are similar .
Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France , a gourmet himself , who was born in the former province of BÃ arn .
In appearance it is light yellow and opaque , smooth and creamy .
Here we highlight the differences .
The difference is only in their flavoring : BÃ arnaise uses shallot , chervil , peppercorn , and tarragon , while Hollandaise uses lemon juice .
It is considered to be a ` child ' of the mother Hollandaise sauce , one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine .
Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics .

No. 1 fuel oil , No. 2 fuel oil ( heating oil ) , and No. 3 fuel oil are referred to as distillate fuel oils , diesel fuel oils , light fuel oils , gasoil or just distillate . For example , No. 2 fuel oil , No. 2 distillate and No. 2 diesel fuel oil are almost the same thing .
Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases . No. 1 fuel oil , No. 2 fuel oil ( heating oil ) , and No. 3 fuel oil are referred to as distillate fuel oils , diesel fuel oils , light fuel oils , gasoil or just distillate .
The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , heavier than gasoline and naphtha .
Fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue .
Diesel is different in that it also has a cetane number limit which describes the ignition quality of the fuel .
Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases .
In this sense , diesel is a type of fuel oil .
Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes and aromatics .
Viscosity also increases with fuel oil number and the heaviest oil has to be heated to get it to flow .
Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael applied the Daubert standard to expert testimony from non scientists .
Three months later , the Carmichaels sued the manufacturer of the tire , claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the accident .
The district court found the tire expert 's methods not to be scientifically valid , and hence excluded his testimony .
This meant that Kumho Tire would prevail .
The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court 's ruling in favor of Kumho Tire .
The Carmichaels ' case rested largely on testimony from a tire failure expert .
Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire expert 's methodology , and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence .
The tire failure expert relied on features of tire technology that the manufacturer did not dispute , as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels ' van .
The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit .
The district court took its cue from Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals , which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert testimony .
Patrick Carmichael was driving his minivan on July 6 , 1993 , when the right rear tire blew out .
One of the passengers in the vehicle died , and others were severely injured .
Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether Daubert applied solely to scientific evidence .
The tire expert 's testimony rested on observation and experience , and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on Rule 702 without the Daubert gloss .
The expert 's conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed .
Under Daubert , certain factors contribute to the reliability , and hence the admissibility , of expert testimony , one of which is the general validity of the expert 's methods .

The Late Heavy Bombardment ( LHB ) or lunar cataclysm , is a period of time approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago ( Ga ) during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon , and by inference on Earth , Mercury , Venus , and Mars as well .
Some argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 3.9 Ga. . They think the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling .
The evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples , which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time .

The title was later used in the monarchies of medieval Europe . In many countries , the constable became a high military rank and great officer of State such as , the Constable of France .
The work and role of a constable can vary a lot in different countries .
Historically , a constable could also be someone in charge of the defense of a castle .
Even today , there is a Constable of the Tower of London .
It is a similar position to Marshal , which comes from Old High German marah `` horse '' and schalh `` servant '' , and originally meant `` stable keeper '' , which has a similar etymology .
However , in the Channel Islands a constable is an elected office holder at the parish level .
In the United Kingdom , Commonwealth of Nations and some European countries , a constable is the lowest rank of police officer . In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer , with less powers than a sheriff .
A constable is a person doing a certain job , most commonly in law enforcement .
In the United States a constable is usually an elected peace officer , with less powers than a sheriff .
Historically , the word constable comes from the Latin , comes stabuli , count of the stables . It came from the Eastern Roman Empire .
Diving nearly vertically at the target , in the same direction the bombs will take , the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed .
A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its targets .
This also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot ; armor was the heaviest near the waterline and thin or non existent on the deck .
Additionally , no complicated precision equipment is needed .
Also , dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying limited bomb load to produce more damage than usual .
Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges .
It was opposed by 11 Southern slave states .

In the coiling method of construction , all of the energy required to form the main part of a piece is supplied directly by the hands of the potter .
However , the name potter 's lathe is also used for the machine used for another shaping process , turning , which is similar to that used for the shaping of metal and wood articles .
In Ancient Egyptian mythology , the god Chnum was said to have formed the first humans on a potter 's wheel .
The potter 's wheel , also known as the potter 's lathe , is a machine used in the shaping of round ceramic wares .
The wheel may also be used during the process of trimming excess body from dried wares and for applying incised decoration or rings of color .
Many early ceramics were hand built using a simple coiling technique in which clay body was rolled into long threads that were then pinched and beaten together to form the body of a vessel .

Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist , and was also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism .
Buddhism was also practiced in the Punjab and Sindh regions .
There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat .
Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet .
Most Buddhists in Punjab reverted to Hinduism from 600 AD onwards .
The Swat Valley , known in antiquity as Uddiyana , was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara .
The Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District , which was then a part of Uddiyana .
Buddhism was the faith practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayad Caliphate in 710 AD .
Gandhara remained a largely Buddhist land until around 800 AD , when the Pashtun people invaded the region from Southern Afghanistan and introduced the Islamic religion .
The region that is today known as Pakistan once had a large Buddhist population , with the majority of people in Gandhara ( present day North Western Pakistan and Eastern Afghanistan ) being Buddhist .

A stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state .
For example , if a 128 bit block cipher received separate 32 bit bursts of plaintext , three quarters of the transmitted data need padding .
Various schemes have been designed to increase the security of LFSRs .
However , the use of LFSRs only is insufficient to provide good security .
In the most common form , binary digits ( bits ) are used , and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation ( XOR ) .
Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware requirements .
Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers .
Another approach is to mark the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output .
Single digit errors are limited in their effect , affecting only up to N plaintext digits .
Based on this key , it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one time pad encryption algorithm . However , because the keystream is pseudorandom , and not truly random , the security associated with the one time pad can not be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure .
An alternative name is a state cipher , as the encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state .
Another approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non linear filtering function .
In a stream cipher the Plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time , and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption state .
The other device can be designed for used in less securely environments .
To restore synchronisation , various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption .
Various properties of such a combining function are important for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme , for example , in order to avoid correlation attacks .
If a block cipher were to be used in this type of application , the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity , since block ciphers can not directly work on blocks shorter than their block size .
If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission , synchronisation is lost .
In a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudo random digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages , and then combined with the plaintext ( to encrypt ) or with the ciphertext ( to decrypt ) .
Self synchronizing stream ciphers is another technique that uses part of the previous N ciphertext digits to compute the keystream .
In practice , the digits are typically single bits or bytes .
However , because the keystream is pseudorandom , and not truly random , the security associated with the one time pad can not be applied and it is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure .
Such schemes are known also as asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey ( CTAK ) .
This can be improved by buffering the output .
In a synchronous stream cipher , the sender and receiver must be in synchronous for decryption to be successful .
An example of a self synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher feedback mode ( CFB ) .
The idea of self synchronization was patented in 1946 , and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits , making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream .
Based on this key , it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar way to the one time pad encryption algorithm .
This output is then ( in some versions ) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate .
Instead of a linear driving device , one may use a nonlinear update function .
A stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient cryptographic keys , for example 128 bits keys .
One technique to introducting non linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly , controlled by the output of a second LFSR .
However , stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly ; for example , in particular , the same starting state must never be used twice .
This technique suffers from timing attacks on the second generator , since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator 's state .
One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a `` 1 '' , otherwise it repeats its previous output .
Normally LFSRs are stepped regularly .
If , however , a digit is corrupted in transmission , rather than added or lost , only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message .
Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear feedback shift registers ( LFSRs ) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be quickly analyzed mathematically .
Such generators include the stop and go generator , the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator .
Because LFSRs are inherently linear , one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of a group of parallel LFSRs into a non linear Boolean function to form a combination generator .
This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high ; however , it makes it less likely that the error would be detected without further mechanisms .
In cryptography , a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream ( keystream ) using an exclusive or ( xor ) operation .
Moreover , because of this property , synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks â '' if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext , he might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit ; for example , flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped ( Toggled ) in the plaintext .
Block ciphers operate on large blocks of fixed length .
The stop and go generator ( Beth and Piper , 1984 ) consists of two LFSRs .
Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding , while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by operating on the smallest transmitted unit ( usually bytes ) .
Another advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated by an encryption device that is subject to strict security measures then fed to other devices , e.g. a radio set , which will perform the xor operation as part of their function .
For example , Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions ( T Functions ) with a single cycle on n bit words .
This is termed a binary additive stream cipher .
Denis Law ( born 24 February 1940 ) is a former Scottish football player .
It is a two player board game in the same family as International chess , and Chinese Xiangqi . Shogi is the most popular of a family of chess variants , and is native to Japan .
In early years , however , shogi was written è æ # ( the same as Xiangqi , `` elephant chess '' ) .
Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th century , while a direct ancestor without the `` drop rule '' was recorded from 1210 in a historical document NichÅ `` reki , which is an edited copy of ShÅ chÅ `` reki and KaichÅ `` reki from the late Heian period ( ~ 1120 ) .
The earliest predecessors of the game , chaturanga , originated in India in the 6th century AD , and spread from China to Japan , where it spawned a number of variants .
According to ChessVariants.com , `` Perhaps the enduring popularity of Shogi can be attributed to its ` drop rule ' ; it was the first chess variant wherein captured pieces could be returned to the board to be used as one 's own .

The physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel , is called ` external ballistics ' .
The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet 's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel .
The make up and density of the target material , the angle of incidence , and the velocity and make up of the bullet itself are all factors .
Mould manufacturers such as RCBS , Paul Jones Moulds , and David Mos offer many different calibers and designs .
Bullets must be produced to a high standard , as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy .
With a mould , bullets can be made at home for reloading one 's own ammunition , where local laws allow .
Bullets must have a surface which will form this seal without causing excessive friction .
Actual bullet shapes are many and varied , and an array of them can be found in any reloading manual that sells bullet moulds .
Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for hand loading and are much more convenient than casting bullets from bulk lead .
The bullet must also engage the rifling ( spiral marks on barrel ) without damaging the gun 's bore .
These unstable bullets tumbled erratically and provided only moderate accuracy , however the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries .
They must form a seal with the gun 's bore ( inner surface of barrel ) .
Bullet designs have to solve two primary problems .
These interactions between bullet and bore are termed ` internal ballistics ' .
Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins .
With smooth bore firearms , a spherical shape was optimum because no matter how it was oriented , it presented a uniform front .
Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically ( spinning keeps it on track ) .
Hand casting , however , is only time and cost effective for solid lead bullets .
If a strong seal is not achieved , gas from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet , reducing efficiency .
For a given material and bullet , the strike velocity is the primary factor determining the result .

The reliance on seasonal rainfall made Tikal open to drought . This is now thought to play a major part in the Classic Maya Collapse .
In this period , Tikal was in charge of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily . This is because it was linked with areas throughout Mesoamerica , such as central Mexican , the center of Teotihuacan .
The ruins are on lowland rainforest , but Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored underground .
However , Tikal did well with intense agricultural techniques . These were more advanced than the slash & burn methods originally theorized by archeologists .
Archaeologists working in Tikal during the last century used the underground facilities to store water for their own use .

Eukaryotic cells are usually much bigger than prokaryotes .
In most eukaryotes , the vesicles with proteins inside fuse with piles of flattened vesicles called the Golgi bodies , where the proteins inside are changed again .
In the complicated plants , most of the inside of a plant cell is taken up by a central vacuole . That central vacuole is the main thing that keeps osmotic pressure so the cell can hold its shape .
The proteins made by the ribosomes attached to the rough ER go to the inside the rough ER , called the lumen .
In multicellular organisms , hormones are often made in vesicles .
In eukaryotic cells , there are many things with membranes around them . All of them together are called the endomembrane system .
Many cells take in food and other things using something called endocytosis . In endocytosis , the membrane closest to the outside bends inwards and then pinches off to make a vesicle .
Simple bags , called vesicles or vacuoles , are sometimes made by budding off other membranes , just like how children make bubbles with their toys .
The cytoskeleton is made up of microtubules and microfilaments . Those parts are very important in the cell 's shape .
After that , they usually go into vesicles , which grow and pinch off from the smooth ER .
Eukaryotic DNA is put in bundles called chromosomes , which are separated by a microtubular spindle during cell division .

The members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single member areas spread among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population .

These are rarely exercised , but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister .
Prior to the 2007 general election , Kevin Rudd , said that he and he alone would choose the ministry if he become Prime Minister .
The Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor General , the Prime Minister and Ministers .
There are times when the government acts in a `` caretaker '' capacity , principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election .
The legislatures of these territories have powers given to them by the Commonwealth . The Commonwealth Parliament keeps the power to overturn territorial legislation and to give or take powers .
That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice President of the Executive Council .
All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council . This council is chaired by the Governor General and which meets solely to approve and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet .
The written agreement is the Australian Constitution . This was written at a Constitutional Convention and voted for by the people of the colonies .
This can be done by an amendment to the Constitution through a referendum .
The Australian Parliament is bicameral , made up of the Queen , a 76 member Senate and a 150 member House of Representatives .
General elections are held at least once every three years .
The question of whether the Queen is Australia 's head of state became a political one during the 1999 Australian republic referendum , when opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claimed that Australia already had an Australian as head of state in the person of the Governor General , who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen .
Though in many respects the Governor General is the Queen 's representative , and exercises various constitutional powers in her name , they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution .

The former Governor General , Major General Michael Jeffery , said in 2004 : `` Her Majesty is Australia 's head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role . ''
In practice , the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people , the Queen of Australia and the Governor General of Australia . The Governor General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia .
The day to day business of the house is usually worked out between a senior Minister , who holds the title Leader of the House , and an Opposition frontbencher known as the Manager of Opposition Business .
The government , because it has a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature , can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house . The Opposition can slow down the process and obstruct government business if it chooses .

Instead , these territories are governed by federal laws , with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands also having local governments .

Local governments are made up of elected representatives ( known as either councilor or alderman depending on the State ) , usually serving on a part time basis .
In ordinary legislation , the two chambers have the same powers , but all laws for spending money or charging taxes must come from the House of Representatives .
This was so the Senators of the smaller States could form a majority and change or even reject laws from the House of Representatives .
It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet , and to carry out various other functions .

The Prime Minister can advise the Governor General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time , but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods set out in the Constitution .
The proposal would have removed the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister , but needing the approval of a two thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament .
The most recent general election was on 21 August 2010 .
All remaining responsibilities are kept by the six States .
The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which shows the different sized populations of the States .
In a 1999 referendum , the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution .

Section 1 of the Australian Constitution sets up a democratic legislature , the bicameral Parliament of Australia . This is the Queen and two houses , the Senate and the House of Representatives .
But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States : all States have 12 Senators , regardless of population .
To become law , the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age . The changes must get a `` double majority '' : a majority of all votes , and a majority of votes in a majority of States .
They have a recognized Leader of the Opposition , usually the leader of the largest party outside the government . There is also a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who `` shadow '' each member of the Ministry , asking questions on matters about the Minister 's responsibilities .

These large sketches , with their free and vigorous brushwork , were revolutionary at the time .
He told Leslie , `` When I sit down to make a sketch from nature , the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture '' .
Although Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions , on the spot studies were essential .
Constable 's idea was to use nature itself , rather than imagination .
The sketches were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air .
To convey the effects of light and movement , Constable used broken brushstrokes , often in small touches , which he worked over lighter passages . This gave an impression of sparkling light over the landscape .
John Constable ( East Bergholt , Suffolk 11 June 1776 London , 31 March 1837 ) was a famous English painter and artist .
p68 `` I have done a good deal of skying '' , Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821 .
When he exhibited it in 1836 , Constable appended a text to the title : `` The mysterious monument of Stonehenge , standing remote on a bare and boundless heath , as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present , carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period '' .
Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable 's work , the oil sketches reveal him to be an avant garde painter , one who showed that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction .
`` The world is wide '' , he wrote , `` no two days are alike , nor even two hours ; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world ; and the genuine productions of art , like those of nature , are all distinct from each other '' .
Constable painted many full scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes in order to test the composition in advance of finished pictures .
p110 In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of clouds .
Constable once wrote in a letter to Leslie , `` My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge , and in every lane , and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up '' .
In addition to the full scale oil sketches , Constable completed numerous studies of landscapes and clouds , to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions .
One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is Seascape Study with Rain Cloud , painted in around 1824 at Brighton , which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes an exploding shower at sea .
The oil sketches of The Leaping Horse and The Hay Wain study convey a vigor missing from his finished paintings of the same subjects .
Constable 's watercolors were also remarkably free for their time . The almost mystical Stonehenge , 1835 , with its double rainbow , is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolors ever painted .
p129 He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be .
Constable 's art inspired not only contemporaries like GÃ ricault and Delacroix , but the Barbizon School , and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century .
The The Chain Pier , 1827 , for example , prompted a critic to write : `` the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it , that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella '' .
To the sky studies he added notes , often on the back of the sketches , of the prevailing weather conditions , direction of light , and time of day , believing that the sky was `` the key note , the standard of scale , and the chief organ of sentiment '' in a landscape painting .
p128 Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects , for example in Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows , 1831 , and in Cottage at East Bergholt , 1833 .

The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews , however , the compromise in features was criticized .
MacBook Air 's launch was accompanied by a television commercial emphasizing its slender design .
To reduce the computer 's size and weight , several features were sacrificed .
To regain the features of an optical drive , users can either use a separately available external USB SuperDrive , or the bundled Remote Disc software to access the optical drive of another computer .
Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results : the deactivation of 1 CPU core appears to have been corrected ; however , the runaway kernel problem remains for at least some users .
Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air , such as the reduction of toxic chemicals like lead , to make it more environmentally friendly .
The full sized keyboard , weight of three pounds , thinness , and Multi Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews , while the limited configuration options , slow speed ( in the non SSD models ) , non user replaceable battery , small hard drive , and price were criticized .
The computer has a glossy LED backlit screen and a backlit keyboard , as well as a large trackpad that responds to iPhone like Multi Touch gestures such as pinching , swiping , and rotating .
The Remote Disc capability is achieved by the computer wirelessly accessing the optical drive of another Mac or Windows PC that has the Remote Disc program installed .
However , for the 2009 revision , the adapter is included in the box .
It also omits a FireWire port , Ethernet port , line in , media card slots , and a Kensington Security Slot .

The problem is aggravated by system intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting .
The music playing is `` New Soul '' by Yael NaÃ m.
For these features , an external USB drive is required .
Additionally , in the 2008 revision , the hard drive , graphics , front side bus , processor , memory , battery , and port connections were upgraded .
Remote Disc supports netbooting , so MacBook Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer 's drive .
This feature requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on the remote computer .
ArsTechnica found `` moderate '' performance improvements of the 64 GB solid state drive of the first generation Air over the standard 80 GB hard drive in tests .
Apple has removed the flip down hatch on the Late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports as on other Macbooks .
Ackerman disliked the limited internet connectivity , slow speed , small hard drive , battery , and the price of SSD hard drive option , however , appreciated the thinness , sturdiness , and the MultiTouch gestures .
The effect can be seen at CPU temperatures as low as 150 Â and worsens with higher temperatures .

The MacBook Air includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard pre installed , along with Apple 's iLife multimedia suite .
With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard , the Air 's multi touch trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters .
It was also Apple 's first computer with an optional solid state storage drive .
Since the release of the first generation product , some MacBook Air users have complained of overheating that caused CPU lockup .
It is Apple 's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built in removable media drive .
It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD .
The MacBook Air was greeted with mixed reception when it was introduced .
The MacBook Air was the first compact laptop sold by Apple since the full featured 12 '' PowerBook G4 was stopped in 2006 .

During the Manhattan Project , which was when the United States , the United Kingdom , and Canada worked together during World War II to make the first nuclear weapons , there was much nuclear espionage in which scientists or technicians working for the project sent information about bomb development and designs to the Soviet Union .
There has been much disagreement over the exact details of these cases , though some of this was settled when VENONA Project transcripts were made public . These were secret messages between Soviet agents and the Soviet government that were discovered and decoded .
The investigations described in the report eventually led to the arrest of Wen Ho Lee , a scientist at Los Alamos , who was at first accused of giving weapons information to China .
Pakistan 's government says that they had no part in the espionage , but refuses to turn Khan over for questioning by the International Atomic Energy Agency .
While some of the information given , such as information given by Klaus Fuchs , could probably have been very helpful , the way the people in charge of the Soviet bomb project actually used the information has led later scholars to think it did not actually speed up the Soviet Union 's process of making bombs much .
On February 5 , 2004 , the president of Pakistan , General Pervez Musharraf , said that he had pardoned Khan .
These people are often called the Atomic Spies , and their work continued into the early Cold War .
Some issues remain unsettled , however .
The report said that China had `` stolen classified information on all of the United States ' most advanced thermonuclear warheads '' since the 1970s , including the design of advanced warheads , the neutron bomb , and `` weapons codes '' which allow for computer simulations of nuclear testing ( and allow China to advance their weapon development without doing its own tests ) .
No other arrests from the theft of the nuclear designs have been made .
There are also rules that keep countries who have signed non proliferation agreements ( which are meant to stop the spread of nuclear weapons ) from sharing information about such weapons with the public .
The United States apparently did not know of this until 1995 .
Whether Vanunu was technically involved in espionage is debated : Vanunu and his supporters say that he should be called as a whistle blower ( someone who was exposing something secret and illegal ) , while his opponents think that he is a traitor and that what he did helped enemies of Israel .
Khan had previously been said to have taken gas centrifuge designs from a uranium enrichment company in the Netherlands ( URENCO ) which he used to help Pakistan 's own nuclear weapons program get started .
Nuclear espionage is sharing a country 's secrets about nuclear weapons to other countries without permission .
The case against Lee eventually fell apart , however , and he was eventually charged only with mishandling of data .
Since nuclear weapons have been invented , there have been many cases of known nuclear espionage , and also many cases where it has thought to have happened , but has not been proven .
Israel has never said that it does or does not have a nuclear weapons program , and Vanunu was kidnapped and smuggled to Israel , where he was convicted of treason and espionage .
In January 2004 , Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan , a Pakistani nuclear scientist , admitted selling restricted nuclear weapons technology to Libya , Iran , and North Korea .
After Vanunu left Israel , he did not give his information right away . He traveled for about a year before doing so .
In 1986 , Mordechai Vanunu , who had worked at a nuclear facility in Israel , gave information about Israel 's nuclear weapons program to the British press . People had thought before that Israel had an advanced and secretive nuclear weapons program and collection , but now they knew for sure .
Because nuclear weapons are usually considered the most important of state secrets , all nations with nuclear weapons have strict rules against sharing information about how nuclear weapons are designed , where they are kept , and other things about them .
According to his testimony and reports from intelligence agencies , Khan sold designs for centrifuges used to enrich uranium and Chinese designs for a nuclear warhead , and sold centrifuges themselves to these three countries .
Other people and groups arrested or fined were scientist Peter Lee ( not related to Wen Ho Lee ) , who was arrested for allegedly giving submarine radar secrets to China , and Loral Space & Communications and Hughes Electronics , who gave China missile secrets .

In the book , Stowe writes about the important characters in Uncle Tom 's Cabin and about people in real life who were like them . Through this book , she writes a more `` aggressive attack on slavery in the South than the novel itself had . ''
In the last few decades , these stereotypes made many people think much more lightly of the historical importance of Uncle Tom 's Cabin as a `` vital antislavery tool . ''
These genres were the most popular novels of Stowe 's time . It usually had female characters and a style that made readers feel sympathy and emotion for them .
Loker has been changed because of the Quakers .
Legree beats him , and decides to destroy Tom 's faith in God .
In The Literary History of the United States , George F. Whicher called Uncle Tom 's Cabin `` Sunday school fiction '' .
Even though there were such criticisms , the novel was still very popular .
The first London edition came out in May 1852 . It sold 200,000 copies .
Uncle Tom 's Cabin was the first widely read political novel in the United States . It greatly influenced American literature and protest literature .
All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy . ''
Many Southern writers , like Simms , soon wrote their own books about slavery .
Tom Loker finally traps Eliza and her family , so that George shoots Loker .
One way Stowe showed the evil of slavery was how it forced families from each other .
However , many of the works in A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin was read by Stowe after she published her novel .
The novel has also been thought unimportant by many critics who called the book `` merely a sentimental novel '' . Critic George Whicher wrote in his Literary History of the United States that `` Nothing attribution to Mrs. Stowe or her handiwork can account for the novel 's enormous ( great ) vogue ; its author 's ( writer 's ) resources as a purveyor of Sunday school fiction were not remarkable .
Because of this , some abolitionists followed some of the principles of women 's suffrage , passivism , and Christianity . They praised men for helping , working together , having mercy , and for their civic .
In Rankin 's story , in February , 1838 , a young slave woman had escaped across the frozen Ohio River to the town of Ripley , Ohio with her child in her arms and stayed at his house before she had gone further towards the north .
A writer said , `` The evil passions which ` Uncle Tom ' gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance ( of slavery ) , but national jealousy and national pride .
St. Clare , however , is stab by a knife at a tavern and dies .
Feminist theory can also be seen in Stowe 's book . The novel can be seen as criticizing slavery 's patriarchal nature .
Stowe 's novel is different from other sentimental novels because she writes about a large theme like slavery .
Uncle Tom 's Cabin also interested many people in England .
George , Eliza , and Harry have finally reached Canada and become free .
Uncle Tom 's Cabins most important theme is the evil of slavery . Every part in Uncle Tom 's Cabin develops the characters and the story .
However , they are hunted by a slave hunter named Tom Loker .
Eva asks her father to buy Tom .
She also believed that only women could save the United States from slavery . Because of this , another very important theme of Uncle Tom 's Cabin is the moral power and sanctity of women .
Legree takes Tom to Louisiana . There , he meets other slaves , including Emmeline ( who Legree bought at the same time that he bought Tom ) .
However , in 1985 Jane Tompkins wrote differently about Uncle Tom 's Cabin in her book In Sensational Designs : The Cultural Work of American Fiction .
It is reported : `` She observed firsthand ( herself ) several incidents ( happenings ) which galvanize her to write ( the ) famous anti slavery novel .
In recent decades , a number of people have begun criticize the book for what are seen as racist descriptions of the book 's black characters . The characters ' looks , speech , behavior , as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom .
Historians are not sure if Lincoln really said this or not . In a letter that Stowe wrote to her husband a few hours after meeting with Lincoln , she does not say anything about this sentence .
This theme can be seen when Tom urges St. Clare to `` look away to Jesus '' after St. Clare 's daughter Eva dies .
Stowe 's son says that when Abraham Lincoln met her in 1862 Lincoln said , `` So this is the little lady who started this great war . ''
At the plantation , Tom meets Cassy , another black slave .
In this idea , the character of George Harris symbolizes the free labor . The complex character of Ophelia shows the Northerners who allowed slavery , even though they did not like it .
As soon as it was published , Uncle Tom 's Cabin made people in the American South very angry .
Eva `` Evangeline '' St. Clare is St. Clare and Marie 's angelic daughter .
The book was read by so many people that Sigmund Freud reported some patients who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom 's Cabin .
In St. Clare 's house , St. Clare argues with his sister , Miss Ophelia . She thinks that slavery is wrong , but is prejudiced against blacks .
When Eva falls into the water and he saves her , Eva 's father , Augustine St. Clare , buys Tom .
Criticisms of the other stereotypes in the book also increased during this time .
The novel was also greatly criticized by people who supported slavery .
Like the novel , A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin was also a best seller .
Another reader said that she thought about the book all the time and even thought about renaming her daughter Eva .
As a best seller , the novel greatly influenced later protest literature .
A famous novelist from the South , William Gilmore Simms , said that the book was not at all true . Others called the novel criminal and slander .
In 1853 , Stowe published A Key to Uncle Tom 's Cabin .
Its translator Lin Shu made this the first Chinese translation of an American novel . It was also translated into Amharic .
Which of Stowe 's characters should be followed : the patient Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris ?
Uncle Tom 's Cabin ; or , Life Among the Lowly is an anti slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe .
This escape of crossing on ice is said to have been inspired by a story heard in the Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati by John Rankin to Stowe 's husband Calvin , a professor at the school .
She had at most a ready command of broadly conceived melodrama , humor , and pathos , and of these â she compounded her book . ''
Uncle Tom 's Cabin is written in a sentimental and melodramatic style . This style was often used in the 19th century sentimental novel and domestic fiction ( also called women 's fiction ) .
Her two children had sold , and she had killed her third child because she was afraid that her child would be sold , too .

In principle , then , the only remaining problem was to be sure that a public key actually belonged to its claimed owner , this is not a problem easy to solve ; specially when the two users involved have never met and know nothing about each other .
In particular , it has not yet been solved for the modern situation of two previously unknown users attempting to communicate electronically , as , for instance , in electronic commerce .
If two parties wish to exchange encrypted messages , each needs to know how to decrypt received messages and to encrypt sent messages .
Public key infrastructures have been proposed go around the problem of `` identity authentication '' .
Each user is responsible for verifying any certificate from another user before using that certificate to communicate with the user who claims to be associated with the particular public key in a certificate , ( see digital signatures ) .
If they use a code , both will require a copy of the same codebook .
Some of the existing work around designs work , more or less , but are not fully satisfactory .
The key exchange problem is how to exchange whatever keys or other information needed so , in such a way , that no one else can obtain a copy .
The problem of key exchange has not yet been solved .
With the arrival of ( public key \/ private key ) cipher algorithms , the encrypting key ( aka , the public key ) could be made public , since ( at least for `` high quality '' ciphers ) no one without the decrypting key ( aka , the private key ) could decrypt the message .
The information they require to do so depends on the encryption technique they might use .
In their most usual implementation , each user applies to a `` certificate authority '' for a digital certificate which serves for other users as a correct ( termed : non tamperable ) authentication of identity .
If the cipher is a symmetric key cipher , both will need a copy of the same key .
Usually , this required trusted secure channel .
If they use a cipher , they will need appropriate keys .

The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde 's career but also heralded his downfall .
In 1963 , Erik Chisholm made an opera from the play .
After imprisonment , he wrote no further comic or dramatic work .
The production was released on audio cassette by the BBC Radio Collection ( ISBN 0 563 47803 9 ) .
The Marquess of Queensberry , father of Lord Alfred Douglas , Wilde 's lover , planned to present Wilde a bouquet of spoiling vegetables and disrupt the show .
George Bernard Shaw , for example , reviewed the play in the Saturday Review . He said that comedy plays should not only be funny but touching , saying , `` I go to the theater to be moved to laughter '' .
Soon afterwards the feud came to a climax in court , and Wilde 's new notoriety caused the play , despite its success , to be closed after just 86 performances .
The Importance of being Earnest , A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde .

In 1849 , James B. Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90 % efficiency .
Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner , creating a force on the blades .
The jet pushes the turbine 's curved blades which reverse the flow .
In the United States , it is now illegal to block the migration of fish so fish ladders must be provided by dam builders .
Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine .
It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low head hydro sites .
The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years .
Water turbines are divided into two groups ; reaction turbines and impulse turbines .
Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields , Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet , which had converted a high head ( hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or penstock ) of water to kinetic energy .
It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today .
In 1844 Uriah A. Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine .
They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades .
In 1879 , Lester Pelton , experimenting with a Knight Wheel , developed a double bucket design , which exhausted the water to the side , eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel .
The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor .
Small turbines ( mostly under 10 MW ) may have horizontal shafts , and even fairly large bulb type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal .
The stationary outlet also had curved guides .
Since the late 20th century , it has been possible to construct hydropower systems that divert fish and other organisms away from turbine intakes without significant damage or loss of power ; such systems require less cleaning but are substantially more expensive to construct .
They could process more water by spinning faster and could use much greater heads .
Since the runner is spinning , the force acts through a distance ( force acting through a distance is the definition of work ) .
The rotating blades or gated runners of water turbines can interrupt the natural ecology of rivers , killing fish , stopping migrations , and disrupting peoples ' livelihoods .
Turgo and Crossflow turbines were later impulse designs .
They produce significant amounts of the world 's electrical supply .
Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements ; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years .
Now they are mostly used for electric power generation .
Some water turbines are designed for Pumped storage hydroelectricity .
For example , American Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest had livelihoods built around salmon fishing , but aggressive dam building destroyed their way of life .
In 1820 , Jean Victor Poncelet developed an inward flow turbine .
Newton 's Third Law of Motion describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines .
Impulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet .
Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design .
Damage areas are cut or ground out , then welding back up to their original or an improved profile .
It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites .
Other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings , packing box and shaft sleeves , servomotors , cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils , seal rings , wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces .
Turbine selection is based mostly on the available water head , and less so on the available flow rate .
Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs .
Large modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90 % ( not to be confused with thermodynamic efficiency ) .
Development occurred during the Industrial revolution , using scientific principles and methods .
The water 's velocity , roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery , does a u turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at 0 velocity .
They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time .
This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92 % efficiency .
( Later , impulse turbines were developed which did not use swirl ) .
This was an efficient machine ( ~ 80 % ) that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension .
Steel elements are repaired by welding , usually with stainless steel rod .
Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime .
In this way , energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine .
He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design .
This is called an impulse or tangential turbine .
Water wheels have been used for thousands of years for industrial power .
Kaplan turbines are well adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions , since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions .
Normal wear and tear is pitting from cavitation , fatigue cracking , and abrasion from suspended solids in the water .
This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power .
It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines .
A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer .
In 1826 Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward flow turbine .
A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water .
Since the turbine is spinning , the force acts through a distance ( work ) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy .
The Francis turbine , named for him , is the first modern water turbine .
No pressure change occurs at the turbine blades , and the turbine does not require a housing for operation .
In general , impulse turbines are used for high head sites , and reaction turbines are used for low head sites .
They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off peak electrical hours , and then revert to a turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand .
In about 1895 , William Doble improved on Pelton 's half cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry .
JÃ n Andrej Segner developed a reactive water turbine in the mid 1700s .
Around 1913 , Victor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine , a propeller type machine .
Reaction turbines are acted on by water , which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy .
They must be encased to contain the water pressure ( or suction ) , or they must be fully submerged in the water flow .
Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head , and makes installation of a generator more economical .
Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design .
The word turbine was coined by the French engineer Claude Bourdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for `` whirling '' or a `` vortex '' .
Their main shortcoming is size , which limits the flow rate and head that can be used .
Some impulse turbines use multiple water jets per runner to increase specific speed and balance shaft thrust .
Around 1890 , the modern fluid bearing was invented , now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles .
This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis in design .
All common water machines until the late 19th century ( including water wheels ) were reaction machines ; water 's pressure head acted on the machine and produced work .
Prior to hitting the turbine blades , the water 's pressure ( potential energy ) is converted to kinetic energy by a nozzle and focused on the turbine .
Historically there have also been negative consequences .
Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal , inspection , and repair of worn parts .
Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head .
The resulting change in momentum ( impulse ) causes a force on the turbine blades .
In 1866 , California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that worked off a completely different concept .
Water pressure decreases to zero as it passes through the turbine blades and gives up its energy .
Water turbines were developed in the nineteenth century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids .
They harness a clean and renewable energy source .
In other words , it is the maximum energy per volume that can be elastically stored .
In physics and engineering , resilience is defined as the capacity of a material to absorb energy when it is deformed elastically and then , upon unloading to have this energy recovered .
An example of a biomaterial which has a high resilience is articular cartilage , the substance lining the ends of bones in articulating joints such as the knee and hip .
Modulus of Resilience , , can be calculated using the following formula : , where is yield stress , E is Young 's modulus , and is strain .
It is represented by the area under the curve in the elastic region in the Stress Strain diagram .
They are Dendrocitta , Crypsirina , Temnurus and Platysmurus .

At the boundary , the western edge of the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the small Mariana Plate .
The Mariana Trench is the deepest known submarine trench . It is also the deepest known location on Earth itself .
The movement of these plates is also responsible for the formation of the Mariana Islands .
Because the Pacific plate is the largest of all the tectonic plates on Earth , crustal material at its western edge has had up to 170 million years to compact and become very dense ; hence its great height difference relative to the higher riding Mariana Plate , at the point where the Pacific Plate crust is subducted .
This deep area is the Mariana trench proper .

Bukit Timah is near the center of Singapore island .
Today , these have been replaced with luxury bungalows , terraces and condominiums , making Bukit Timah Singapore 's premier residential district .
The Japanese war dead were brought back to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine , while the remains of the British troops were instituted at the British Commonwealth 's Kranji War Memorial in Singapore .
For example , the Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Dunearn Road is being redeveloped into condominiums for sale .
The hill was on the map as the eastern source of the Kranji River .
Two war memorials dedicated to the Japanese war dead and surprisingly , to the deceased British troops who died defending Singapore , were built at the site .
The present site where the Shinto Shrine existed , lied at a gray area between the Nature Reserve and Singapore Armed Forces restricted area .
The hill was an `` excellent sanatorium '' , as the air was `` cooler and fresher than the plain , producing an agreeable exhilaration of spirits '' .
The Wayang Satu and Bukit Timah village parts are differently called .
Several historians have been down at the site , and an episode from then Television Corporation of Singapore ( TCS ) history documentary show , `` Hey Singapore '' , was on the mysterious Shinto Shrine .
The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore , and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve , which is partially responsible for its high land value .
This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah ( District 21 ) was formed .
During the Japanese Occupation , the Japanese troops built a Syonan to Shinto shrine ( Syonan to was the Occupation name for Singapore ) , similar to the National Shinto in Japan but of a smaller size , at Bukit Timah Hill .
It was only shortly before the Japanese surrender , the Japanese forces hastily destroyed the Shinto Shrine , on fears that returning British forces will demolish it in an bad manner .
During World War II , the British Army lost Bukit Timah to the Japanese on February 11th , they knew they had little chance of winning the war as most of their food and supplies were stored there .
The surrounding area is called Bukit Timah .
Nothing of the Syonan to Shinto shrine remains , except for the Holy Cleansing Pond and several Japanese stone pavements left at the site .
This only refers to the lower end of the Bukit Timah Road .
In 1860 , nearly 200 people were reported to have been killed by tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations .
The first ride on horseback across the island was along Bukit Timah Road in 1840 ; it took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr Little .
The rise in land prices has led to development of new condominiums .
After the Japanese Occupation , the farms and plantations in Bukit Timah gave way to industrial buildings and high rise flats .
The Bukit Timah Race Course , a Thoroughbred horse racing facility , was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999 .
Apparently , the area was so infested with tigers that it constituted a serious threat to human life .
Bukit Timah , which means `` tin bearing hill '' in Malay , was on the 1828 map by Frankin and Philip Jackson as Bukit Timah .
Students , Japanese commanders , British POWs ' representatives would gather there regularly to commemorate the dead during the Occupation .
Many expatriates and well heeled Singaporeans tend to stay in this region .
The nature reserve was established in 1883 .
The Hokkiens also refer to Bukit Timah as be chia lo bue , meaning `` end of the horse carriage road '' .
The road to Kranji was completed in 1845 .
No plans have been indicated to restore the site , on speculations of angry responses from the People Republic of China ( PRC ) and abroad .
Bukit Timah is 10 kilometres ( 6 miles ) from Singapore 's business district .
This course is closed to the public , unlike the former course ( now Farrer Park ) where the general public enjoyed watching the king 's sport for free .
The Keretapi Tanah Melayu from Malaysia has a passing loop station here along its rail network from Johor Bahru to Tanjong Pagar .
The 25 km long Bukit Timah Road , the longest road in Singapore , running north and south of the island , takes its name from this hill .
In December 1843 , a road was built up to the hill .
The nearby area houses many bungalows , traditionally expensive in land scarce Singapore , as well as high rise condominiums .
For some , it is synonymous with the Singapore Turf Club , where members and paying visitors flock on race days .
Bukit Timah Road is known as tek kha kang a kinn in Hokkien , which means `` the side of the stream in the tek kha ( or Selegie Road ) district '' .
Since then , the Singapore Government has erected the place as `` Historical Site '' .
The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value .
In the 1960s and 1970s , Bukit Timah was a major industrial center .
On 15 February 1942 , the head of the Allied forces , Lieutenant General A.E. Percival surrendered to Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah .

Epicureanism is a philosophy based on the teachings of Epicurus . Epicureanism was started around 307 BC .
Epicureanism was originally a challenge to Platonism , though later it became the main opponent of Stoicism .
Epicurus was a materialist who believed there were atoms . The teaching about atoms was first started by Democritus .
Epicurus spoke favorably about the enjoyment of simple pleasures ; He also meant abstaining from bodily desires , such as sex and appetites , almost like asceticism .
Epicurus and his followers shunned politics .
After the death of Epicurus , his school was headed by Hermarchus ; later many Epicurean societies flourished in the Late Hellenistic era and during the Roman era ( such as those in Antiochia , Alexandria , Rhodes and Ercolano ) .
Some scholars consider the epic poem On the Nature of Things by Lucretius to present in one unified work the core arguments and theories of Epicureanism .
Epicureanism is a form of hedonism , because it declares that pleasure is the only good there really is .
He argued that when eating , one should not eat too richly , for it could lead to dissatisfaction later , such as the grim realization that one could not afford such delicacies in the future .
Some writings by Epicurus have survived .
Likewise , sex could lead to increased lust and dissatisfaction with the sexual partner .
In the Epicurean view , the highest pleasure ( tranquility and freedom from fear ) was obtained by knowledge , friendship and living a virtuous and temperate life .
Epicurus did not articulate a broad system of social morality that has survived .
The poet Lucretius is its most known Roman proponent .
By the end of the Roman Empire , having undergone Christian attack and repression , Epicureanism had all but died out , and would be resurrected in the 17th century by the atomist Pierre Gassendi , who adapted it to the Christian doctrine .
At least some are thought to have belonged to the Epicurean Philodemus .
Many of the papyrus scrolls unearthed at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum are Epicurean texts .

In a flashback during `` The Storm '' , Aang remembered the day when elder monks told him that he was the Avatar .
According to the show 's creators , `` Avatar based on the belief of Buddhism and Taoism . ''
The show follows Aang 's journeys to do this .
Due to his non violent nature , he also shows ethical reluctance refusing to killing Firelord Ozai , and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him .
These characteristics were meant to show the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show .
When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger , he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh chakra is opened , locking it .
The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing .
It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and sends him into the ocean during his escape .
This is the spirit of the planet in human form .
The show 's directors , Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , say the events are canon .
Aang accepts , despite the group 's strong opposition .
In 2008 , M. Night Shyamalan , a film director , cast 12 year old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series , The Last Airbender .
Nearing the end , the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much , so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple .
Aang is a vegetarian , as shown in `` The King of Omashu '' ( the 5th episode of first season ) and `` The Headband '' ( the 2nd episode of third season ) when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that life is holy .
Aang shows a reluctance to fight and an dislike of killing .
Konietzko changed the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison .
Later , Aang and his friends learn about the solar eclipse , which will occur before the end of the summer , and will block the Firebenders powerless .
After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion turtle , and receiving advice from said lion turtle , he prepares to confront the Fire Lord .
After the 100 years he was in the iceberg with his bison , the story starts when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the first episode .
An image of this air bubble , resembling an iceberg , ends the flashback .
He also showed that he can act immaturely , and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together .
Aang then enters the Avatar State , unknowingly , for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble .
The creators of the show made Aang to be frozen in an iceberg for 1000 years .
Airbending , the element that Aang mainly uses in the show , is based on Baguazhang , an `` internal '' Chinese martial art .
The character was made by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen .
The plot they described relates with the first and second episodes of the series , where the `` water people '' ( Katara and Sokka ) find the `` air guy '' ( Aang ) while `` trapped in a snowy wasteland '' ( the Southern Water Tribe ) with `` some fire people ( that ) are pressing down on them '' ( Fire Navy and Zuko ) .
Once Ozai arrives , Aang engages him in battle .
He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se .
Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord Ozai , discouraging him .
Aang 's character was created by Bryan Konietzko .
Tokyopop has published a films comic ( sometimes referred to as cine manga ) , in which Aang is the main character , like in Avatar : The Last Airbender .
He was to wake inside a futuristic world , where he would have a robot named Momo and a flying bison named Appa .
The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang ( as well as a primarily Caucasian cast ) in the Asian influenced Avatar universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism , a letter writing campaign , and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras .
There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a child like character who is `` reckless and excitable '' .
Aang is the last Airbender . They were the only race of people who could control the air .
In the Brahmajala Sutra , a Buddhist code of ethics , vegetarianism is encouraged .
The game has some plot changes that are not in the show .
The idea caused the pair to think :
Aang , in `` The Storm '' ( the 12th episode of first season ) , said that he wishes he had been there to help Air Nomads a century ago , but would rather live a child 's carefree life .
In `` Bato of the Water Tribe '' ( the 15th episode of first season ) , Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father .
Aang is in Escape from the Spirit World , an online video game that is on Nickelodeon 's real website .
Most of Aang 's habits , such as vegetarianism , are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition .
Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor ; he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison , Appa .
Aang is the series ' unwilling hero . He shows hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation .
In the next episode , they all started the trip to the Northern Water Tribe , with hope to find a waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control the water .
The sketch showed a middle aged man with an arrow on his head .
When the team , named team `` Avatar '' , arrived in the Northern Water Tribe , a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang ( and later Katara ) waterbending .

A few scholars , most prominently Christopher Beckwith and Roy Andrew Miller , argue that Chinese is not related to Tibeto Burman .
In opposition to this view , scholars in favor of the Sino Tibetan hypothesis such as W. South Coblin , Graham Thurgood , James Matisoff , and Gong Hwang cherng have argued that there are regular correspondences in sounds as well as in grammar .
The Sino Tibetan languages form a language family composed of , at least , the Chinese and the Tibeto Burman languages , including some 250 languages of East Asia .
They are second only to the Indo European languages in terms of their number of speakers .
They point to an absence of regular sound correspondences , an absence of reconstructable shared morphology , and evidence that much shared lexical material has been borrowed from Chinese into Tibeto Burman .

The Earl Marshal , a hereditary office held by the Duke of Norfolk , oversees the College , but he is not a member .
A partial exception to this rule is the case of a woman who has no brothers , or whose brothers have no children ; such a woman is called a heraldic heiress and may transmit the arms to her children as a quartering with their father 's arms , and to their descendents .
There are , three levels of officers of arms : Kings of Arms , Heralds , and Pursuivants .
The Earl Marshal 's court ( called the Court of Chivalry ) can hear cases about using coats arms , but the court has not sat since 1954 .
The officers of arms occupy posts bearing traditional titles :
The Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent . Before they can even consider the granting of arms , an application , ( called a memorial ) must be made to the Earl Marshal , and a fee paid .
Although daughters and sons inherit the right to bear arms for themselves personally , the right passes only through the male line : hence , a son transmits the arms to his children , but a daughter , can use them herself , but her children can not .
If it does proceed , its success or otherwise will depend on the approval of the Earl Marshal , who may apply his own standards .
Before they can even consider the granting of arms , an application , ( called a memorial ) must be made to the Earl Marshal , and a fee paid .
( Scotland has its own heraldic authority : Lord Lyon King of Arms and his office . )
The applicant does not buy a coat of arms : the arms themselves are freely given , but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists involved as professionals , and to support the buildings and other running costs of the College .
For these public appearances , the officers of the college wear costume showing their place in the Royal Household , either simple red livery or the herald 's traditional colourful outfit of a tabard emblazoned with his master 's arms ( in this case the royal arms ) .
If a herald is approached and does not consider that the application has merit , he may tactfully suggest to the applicant that he or she should not proceed .
The college is involved in genealogy and have many pedigrees ( family trees ) in their records .
William IV reduced them to the old level in the 1830s .
The Kings of Arms grant coats of arms by letters patent .
The Kings of Arms are authorised in their `` patents of appointment '' ( the letter giving them their job ) to grant coats of arms to `` eminent men '' .
These salaries were set centuries ago and reflect the living costs of the day .
The officers of arms earn money from their own private practices in heraldry and genealogy . They get only nominal salaries as officers of the College .
The College of Arms does not need to approve the use of the arms in each generation : the original grant of arms is the only authority required .
By 1530 , the heralds wanted successful candidates for a grant of arms to have Â # 300 or rent from land of Â # 10 a year .
The costs involved are quite substantial .
As well as designing and granting new arms , the College tries to answers many requests from people trying to prove that they are descended from an armigerous ( arms bearing ) person ; a person descended in the male line ( or through heraldic heiresses ) from an armiger may be reissued that ancestor 's arms .
Since the heralds get fees for granting arms , they have always been generous when deciding who should be allowed a coat of arms .
The coat of arms , or a differenced version of them using marks of cadency , can be used by all of the legitimate children of an individual and such children and their descendants may bear the arms ( or a differenced version of them ) from the moment of birth : they do not have to wait for the death of the previous generation .
When a Royal Licence is granted for a transfer of arms , the change of the surname may be permitted by the Licence itself , so there is no need of a deed poll .

Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface , where we live .
The gases evolved during the melting of Earth 's mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earth 's atmosphere .
It lies about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres .
A thin crust , the upper part of the lithosphere , surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75 km thick .
In 2007 a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering .
It is called the asthenosphere , and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity , about 200 km thick , and the lowermost part of the lithosphere , composed of rigid rock , about 50 to 120 km thick .
The uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere , an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200 km , of which the uppermost mantle is 120 to 50 km thick .

This last office , the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood , has lain vacant for many years .
According to E.S. Drower , the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features , which also appear in various forms in other gnostic sects :
These laws are regularly applied to discriminate against religious and ethnic groups that are not officially recognized , such as the Mandaeans .
The current status of the Mandaeans has prompted a number of American intellectuals and civil rights activists to call for their government to extend refugee status to the community .
, Neo Mandaic ganzeá rÄ nÄ ) and the riÅ amma `` leader of the people . ''
Mani later left the Elkasaites to start his own religion .
The contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century .
One of the most important works of Mandaean scripture is the DraÅ a d Iahia `` the Book of John the Baptist '' . This book is accessible to both laymen and initiates .
The 2003 Iraq War reduced the population of Iraqi Mandaeans to approximately 5,000 by 2007 .
There are small Mandaean populations in Australia ( c. 3,500 as of 2006 ) , Canada , the USA ( c. 1,500 ) , the UK ( c. 1,000 ) and Sweden ( c. 5,000 ) .
The language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally written is known as Mandaic , and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects .
The majority of Mandaean lay people do not speak this language .
It is difficult to say if groups such as the Elkasaites , the Mughtasila , the Nasoraeans , and the Dositheans are related to the Mandaeans or to one another .
Mandaeans have several prophets .
While they agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons , they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one .
Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion . They only worship him as one of their greatest teachers .
In Iran , Mandeans do not have a problem with violence , but they are prohibited from fully participating in civil life because of Gozinesh Law .
The members of this sect wore white and performed baptisms like the Mandaeans .
Mandaeans believe in marriage and procreation , and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world . They put a high priority on family life .
A legend called HarrÄ n GÄ wetÄ also strengthens this . According to this legend , the Mandaeans left Palestine after the destruction of Jerusalem in the 1st century AD and settled inside the Arsacid empire .
Although the Ginza continued to evolve under the rule of the Sassanians and the Islamic empires , few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity .
Traditionally , any ganzeá rÄ who baptizes seven or more ganzeá rÄ nÄ may qualify for the office of riÅ amma , though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate .
The Elkasaites were a Christian baptismal sect which may have been related to the Mandaeans .
There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide , and until the 2003 Iraq war , almost all of them lived in Iraq .
A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist .
The members of this sect , like the Mandaeans , wore white and performed baptisms .
Ibn al Nadim also mentions a group called the Mughtasila , `` the self ablutionists , '' who may be identified with one or the other of these groups .
This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts .
Likewise , the Mandaeans believe that Abraham , Moses , and Muhammad were false prophets , but recognize other prophetic figures from the monotheistic traditions , such as Adam , his sons Hibil ( Abel ) and Å itil ( Seth ) , and his grandson AnuÅ ( Enosh ) , as well as Nuh ( Noah ) , his son Sam ( Shem ) and his son Ram ( Aram ) .
The corpus of Mandaean literature is quite large . It also covers topics such as eschatology , the knowledge of God , and the afterlife .
In 1831 , an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities .
Mandaeism or Mandaeanism ( Mandaic : Mandaiuta , MandÄ ` iyya ) is a monotheistic religion . The religion has a strong dualistic world view .
Other groups which have been identified with the Mandaeans include the `` Nasoraeans '' , described by Epiphanius , and the Dositheans , mentioned by Theodore Bar KÅ nÄ `` in his Scholion .
Other important books include the QolastÄ , the `` Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans , '' which was translated by E.S. Drower .
The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors .
Jorunn J. Buckley looked at these special marks the copyists left in the Left Ginza . That way he was able to show that the copying of that text goes back to the to the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD .
This law and other gozinesh provisions require a religious screening for people who want to access employment , education , and a range of other areas . A very important part of this screening procedure is devotion to the tenets of Islam .
Mandaeans will , however , abstain from strong drink and red meat .
Two of the surviving acolytes ( Å gandia ) , Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun , reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them .
Its followers , the Mandaeans , think highly of Adam , Abel , Seth , Enosh , Noah , Shem , Aram and especially John the Baptist .
The most important of them is the GenzÄ RabbÄ or Ginza . The Ginza is a collection of history , theology , and prayers .
They lived in east Judea and northern Mesopotamia . According to the Harran GawaitÄ legend , the Mandaeans migrated to southern Mesopotamia from there .
At the moment , the highest office currently occupied is that of the ganzeá rÄ , a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis ( ca .
Consequently , Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism .
The Mandaic word k ( a ) daba , however , comes from two roots : the first root , meaning `` to lie , '' is the one traditionally given to Jesus ; the second , meaning `` to write , '' might provide a second meaning , that of `` book '' . Some Mandaeans , who are motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit , maintain that Jesus was not a `` lying Messiah '' but a `` book Messiah '' .
It is based on a common history and heritage . There is no fixed set of religious creeds and doctrines .
This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature .
Mandaeans maintain that Jesus was a mÅ iha kdaba `` false messiah '' who changed the teachings given to him by John .
Mandaean scholar SÃ ve S Ã derberg showed that Mani 's Psalms of Thomas were closely related to Mandaean texts .
According to the Fihrist of ibn al Nadim , Mani , the founder of Manichaeism , was brought up within the Elkasaites ( Elcesaites or Elchasaite ) sect .
There were over 60,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s . In 2007 , only about 5,000 to 7,000 remain there ; over 80 % of Iraqi Mandaeans were refugees in Syria and Jordan .

IDEA can be used with the OpenPGP standard .
Each of the eight round uses six sub keys , while the half round uses four ; for a total of 52 sub keys . Each sub key is a 16 bit in length .
IDEA operates on 64 bit blocks , using a 128 bit key . It contains a series of eight identical transformations ( rounds ) and one output transformation ( the half round ) .
IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups modular addition and multiplication , and bitwise eXclusive OR ( XOR ) which are chosen to be `` algebraically incompatible '' .
The processes for encryption and decryption are similar .
As of 2007 , the best attack which applies to all keys can break IDEA if reduced to 6 rounds ( the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds ) .
( Applied Cryptography , 2nd ed . )
In 1996 , Bruce Schneier wrote about IDEA , `` In my opinion , it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time . ''
The designers analyzed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is unsusceptible only under certain assumptions .
However , by 1999 he was no longer recommending IDEA due to the availability of faster cryptographic algorithms , some progress in its cryptanalysis , and the issue of patents .
Today , IDEA is licensed worldwide by a company called MediaCrypt .
In cryptography , the International Data Encryption Algorithm ( IDEA ) is a block cipher designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey of ETH Zurich in 1991 .
IDEA very like an earlier cipher called Proposed Encryption Standard ( PES ) , but with some improvements . Because of this , IDEA was first called IPES ( Improved PES ) .
The first eight sub keys are extracted directly from the 128 bit key , with K1 being the lowest sixteen bits and K8 is the highest sixteen bits ; further groups of eight keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits after the creation of the previous group ; six rotations generate all sub keys .
The cipher is patented in a number of countries but can be used by anyone for non commercial use .
The name `` IDEA '' is also a trademark .
It was meant to be a replacement for the Data Encryption Standard .

Madison sought to accomplish this by demonstrating conclusively that the Acts violated the constitution .
Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Republican members of Congress departing for their home states , and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce .
Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions , and in other states there was very little public comment .
Other cases to cite the Report for a similar purpose include Thornhill v. Alabama ( 1940 ) and Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC ( 2000 ) .
The general purpose of the Report was the affirmation and expansion of the principles in the Virginia Resolutions .
In the 1957 Roth v. United States opinion by William Brennan , Madison 's Report is cited as evidence that `` the fundamental freedoms of speech and press have contributed greatly to the development and well being of our free society and are indispensable to its continued growth . ''
As well , Madison attacked Federalist carriage laws and bank laws as unconstitutional .
In defense of Virginia Republicans and the Resolutions , Madison emphasized that even if one disagreed with the compact theory , the Virginia Resolutions and the Report of 1800 themselves were simply protests , which states were surely entitled to produce .
Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not .
Though it had little impact on the immediate election , Madison 's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states ' rights in general , particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy .
The arguments made in the Resolutions and the Report were later used frequently during the nullification crisis of 1832 , when South Carolina declared federal tariffs to be unconstitutional and void within the state .
To remedy the defects revealed by the passage of the Alien and Sedition Acts , Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech .
Freedom of the press was necessary , because `` chequered as it is with abuses , the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression . ''
Contrary to the Sedition Act , the federal government had no power to protect officials from dissent or libelous attack , beyond the protection it accorded to every citizen ; indeed , such special intervention against the press was `` expressly forbidden by a declaratory amendment to the constitution . ''
The measure came before the House of Delegates , the lower house of the General Assembly , on January 2 .
These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional , and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary .
However , James Monroe , who would become Governor of Virginia before the end of the year , visited Jefferson at Monticello and cautioned him against meeting with Madison , since another meeting between two of the most important Republican leaders would provoke significant public comment .
The state governments themselves , no less than the federal judiciary , possess only delegated power and therefore can not decide questions of fundamental importance .
This resolution had been the principal target of the Federalist attack on the Resolutions .
Particularly at issue was the sense in which the states were parties to the federal compact .
The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact , and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power .
The Report was received warmly by Virginia Republicans .
The Alien Act granted the President the unenumerated power of deporting friendly aliens .
The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts , four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will , required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens , and made it a crime to publish malicious or defamatory material against the government or its officials .
Henry Clay said on the floor of the House of Representatives that it was from the Report of 1800 , above other documents , that he had developed his own theories on constitutional interpretation .
At the time , leading Virginia Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles ( in public ) and Sen. John Taylor of Caroline ( in private ) actually were contemplating disunion , and the Virginia General Assembly chose this juncture for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond , so there was some truth to the charge .
They were `` expressions of opinion , unaccompanied with any other effect than what they may produce on opinion by exciting reflection . ''
The Resolutions , usually discussed together with Thomas Jefferson 's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions , were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist dominated national government .
The first major goal of the Resolutions was to bring about the repeal of the Alien and Sedition Acts by generating public opposition that would be expressed through the state legislatures .
The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and distributed in the state , but there was not much public response to the Report , and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 ( which was , nevertheless , a major victory for the Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies ) .
Jefferson underlined the importance of this work in a November 26 letter to Madison in which he identified `` protestations against violations of the true principles of our constitution '' as one of the four primary elements of the Republican Party plan .
The Virginia General Assembly adopted the Report in January 1800 . The document primarily subtly amends arguments from the 1798 Virginia Resolutions .
Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to `` a protection of those who administer the government , if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people , against being exposed to it . ''
In more recent years , the main practical interest in the Report has been its absolutist understanding of the First Amendment .
H. Jefferson Powell , a modern jurist , identifies three persistent themes of Republican constitutionalism which emerged from the Resolutions and the Report : ( 1 ) a textual approach to the Constitution , ( 2 ) the compact theory , and ( 3 ) that caution , not trust , should characterize our approach to those who hold political power .
A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly 's 1798 Virginia Resolutions , of which Madison had been the draftsman .
The Report of 1800 , Madison argued , did not say the government was a compact of the individual states , as the pro nullification elements suggested .
Multiple Supreme Court decisions have cited the case as evidence of the Framers ' ideas on free speech .
The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly , led in the effort by state sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline , had put a state sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison 's hopes .
The Report of 1800 was a resolution drafted by James Madison . It argued for the sovereignty of the individual states under the United States Constitution and against the Alien and Sedition Acts .
However , Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro nullification Southerners .
Once at Richmond , Madison began drafting the Report , though he was delayed by a weeklong battle with dysentery .
The Report was regarded in the early 19th century as among the more important expressions of Republican principles .
In modern scholarship outside the legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states ' rights with regard to federalism and republicanism .
The Virginia Resolutions had in the year since publication received highly critical replies from state legislatures , including those of New York , Delaware , and the five New England states .
Madison , a member of the Republican Party , was elected to the Republican dominated Virginia General Assembly from Orange County in 1799 .
Despite Jefferson 's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison 's work , the national reaction was tepid .
Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union , which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above .
The Assembly session began in early December .
The Federalists accused the Republicans of seeking disunion , even contemplating violence .
Republicans were outraged by the legislation , and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures .
Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of `` the people in each of the States , acting in their highest sovereign capacity . ''
The Report was the last important explication of the Constitution produced before the 1817 Bonus Bill Veto Message .
More generally , the Report made the argument in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states , for which it is best known .
The Report was ultimately amended to provide greater clarity on this issue by emphasizing that it was the people themselves , acting through the states in their sovereign capacity , who were parties to the Constitution .
Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon , examining Jefferson 's later writing , conclude that Madison had a significant role `` in softening Jefferson 's more extreme views . ''
This doctrine is known as the compact theory .
At the very least , Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Republicans .
The committee members were Madison , John Taylor , William Branch Giles , George Keith Taylor , John Wise , John Mercer , and William Daniel .
At some point in the next two weeks , it passed the Senate by a margin of 15 to 6 .
Spencer Roane described it as `` the Magna Charta on which the republicans settled down , after the great struggle in the year 1799 . ''
On December 23 , Madison moved for the creation of a special seven member committee with himself as chairman to respond to `` certain answers from several of the states , relative to the communications made by the Virginia legislature at their last session . ''
Either formulation would help the Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary , both of which were dominated by Federalists .
The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment .
The amended Report passed the House of Delegates on January 7 by a margin of 60 to 40 .
In response to this letter , Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello during the first week of September .
The task of writing the Virginia Report was left solely to Madison .
Jefferson hoped for further involvement with the production of the Report and planned to visit Madison at Montpelier on his way to Philadelphia , the national capital , for the winter session of the United States Congress .
While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press , but implying that such power existed , Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press .
Whether Madison 's theory of republicanism really supported the nullification movement , and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period , are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature .
Madison , however , rejected the concept of nullification and the notion that his arguments supported such a practice .
It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Republicans as leaning toward secession ; in the amended Report the line is moderated , with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people ( and therefore , one reads in , not the state legislatures alone ) which possess this power .
Laying into the Acts in his Report , Madison described many breaches of constitutional limits .
The next day , Christmas Eve , the committee produced a first version of the Report .
By eschewing direct action in favor of influencing popular opinion , Madison tried to make clear that the Republicans were not moving toward disunion .

Folk metal was not well known and there were n't many bands in the genre during the 1990s .
In 1994 and 1995 more and more bands in the genre appeared from different places in Europe and also in Israel .
This music genre is a mixture of heavy metal and traditional folk music .
The Irish band Cruachan was one of these early bands , and so were the bands Orphaned Land , from Israel , and the German band Subway to Sally . Each band started to develop their own styles of folk metal and these styles became Celtic metal , Oriental metal and Medieval metal .
Folk metal is a subgenre of heavy metal music that started in Europe in the 1990s .
A few bands also use keyboards to make the sound of folk instruments .
Lyrics in Folk metal are normally about nature , fantasy , mythology and history .
The earliest example of folk metal was the English band Skyclad .
Their first album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was made in 1990 .
Folk instruments are used a lot and sometimes traditional singing styles are also used .
The music of Folk metal is very diverse . Different bands perform a lot of different styles .

Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen .
Each tip of the `` Y '' of an antibody contains a structure ( like a lock ) that fits one particular key like structure on an antigen . This binds the two structures together .
The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .
Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved . These allow vertebrate B cells to generate a huge pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes .
The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen .
Actually , humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies , each capable of binding a distinct antigen site .
This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens .
Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly .
Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , that small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable . This allows millions of antibodies with different tip structures to exist .

language , affectionately known as `` wikipuke '' .
: : : ( This essay is a draft to be expanded later . )
Rather than maintaining some basic , core levels of simplicity , the multiple nerdisms start interfering with earlier peculiar features , and the result becomes conflicting nerdisms with almost unpredictable , expanding quirks .
Do n't design coding as quotebox .
The exact causes , behind each quirk , are perhaps too complex to explain in this essay .
Perhaps the world is seeing a rapid growth in the rise of `` nerdnology '' as typical notions of quality control have been abandoned , almost everywhere .
Instead , the quirks are not the work of college dropout billionaires , but rather just a collection of misdirected changes .
So even an organization with $ billions of revenue can not seem to avoid utterly spastic , peculiar quirks in their webpages .
In the second use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 is only `` aaa '' because the vertical bar ( or pipe ) '' '' stopped param1 from including the line break newline .
Kids do n't do this .
Those preferences could be set to overcome some design flaws in the basic design of a system ( such as a browser ) , until the more normal settings are preset as the defaults in later software versions .
For example , in some mainsteam browsers :
, some really bizarre features are added , such as allowing wiki templates to pass newlines at the end of parameter values , simply by indenting the next line , when calling a template .
Unfortunately , `` one man 's bizarreness is other man 's ordinary dork otopia '' and some developers think that everyone should change their ways to adjust to the new stuff .
Even Google Inc. , with all the $ billions , has had some very unusual things happening in the official websites ( for years ) :
Overly often , peculiar ideas are treated as mainstream `` everyone should know nerdisms '' which become some of the widespread quirks that appear , from day to day .
Ah so , oh so important quotebox he look like : Me is quotebox â `` I so cool , so important .
This essay , WP : Avoiding Wikipedia quirks , is intended to try to explain what is happening , hourly , to the Wikipedia system , and to suggest work around solutions .
Wikipedia 's underlying software system , with the MediaWiki markup language , is constantly being changed to fix old problems and try to offer new , better features , but better for whom ?
Not all problems are caused by Wikipedia 's software configuration .
However , along with that stuff , there is a 2nd language as wikitable codes ( in Table ) , so that a table begins with '' '' which formerly were required in column 1 but can be indented now ( at least sometimes , or maybe not whatever ) .
Everything is changing , without warning , and lots of it is quirky .
The most normal language is the typical free flowing text that allows triple quote ` bold font ' , along with the HTML tags , such as .
In the first use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 can be considered to be `` xxx '' because the coding was split , with param2 ( value `` yyy '' ) on the 2nd line .
Normally , bizarre features would be designed to require special coding to trigger those features , such as : if you want to pass newlines in parameter values , then specify them , explicitly , such as `` param = aa # nuline ; bb # nuline ; cc # nuline ; '' where the code '' # nuline ; '' or '' '' ( or some other invented thing ) is the feature to be requested .
No longer are major changes tested on a sample user group , but instead , released untested to the entire world .
However , imagine the stress on the Wikipedia developers , having to ensure that any changes or enhancements , to the MediaWiki interfaces , must continue to work as before , generating the same demented , peculiar sets of quotebox indentations , everywhere they had popped up before .
By considering the design flaws , and the operational instability , it is possible to get a better understanding of the psychological pressures that people face when using Wikipedia .
Many problems are actually from each user 's PC setup or browser , such as pressing F5 or ( before edit preview ) and losing all edit text ( see below : Browser nightmares ) .
There are hundreds of unusual , or unexpected quirks or glitches in the way things sort of do , sort of don ' t work .
The quirks are not merely planned obsolescence , similar to allowing computer viruses , which are known to kill user computers and cause people to buy new or fix it software products ( as the planned result ) .
All of those problems are caused by quirky browser operation ( not Wikipedia ) , as the browser does not reflect the way that people actually think .
Me is quotebox â `` wiki would die without me .
Knowing the details , about specific quirks , can help avoid the stress or frustrations in the future .
On any given day , new problems might arise , or old problems get fixed , as the developers adjust the servers or hack the MediaWiki code to alter character shift typesetting for the 200 + Wikipedia languages ( see below : Why quirks occur ) .
Even the most level headed , otherwise normal software developers will become overwhelmed by the pre exising nerdisms , so that even simple changes can introduce new quirks , and hence , no single group of people can be blamed for the combined , bizarre outcomes .
Many problems that users think are caused by Wikipedia are actually caused by limited Web browsers .
Well , as can be expected with multiple personality disorder ( MPD ) , the 3 languages fight for power : when HTML code is formatted with typical indentation , the me is quotebox personality , at times , hijacks the page , and you get hypertext markup laughter displayed in a box that looks like ( ... wait for it ... ) a QuoteBox !
Wikipedia is not alone in having many website quirks .
Then there is the 3rd language : the `` infamous '' if you indent , you get `` quotebox '' yes the all important quotebox , which in computer typesetting typically requires only 2 markers ; instead , just indent and the whole section turns into quotebox â `` quotebox â `` quotebox .
Many changes are made to support the unusual typesetting needs of rare written languages that use split character placement of text or other unusual options not seen in English or other European languages .
Complicating the complications is the reality that , eventually , several multiple nerdisms are implemented .
The MediaWiki markup language is a peculiar twisto mash of 3 computer languages .
Far surpassing `` creeping featurism '' the total system becomes `` featured creepyism '' .
The above text , with the multi line footnote shows use of 4 HTML comment lines '' '' to simulate indenting by putting each text segment on a separate line .
Sometimes ( or often ? )
Me is quotebox â `` I exist here 8 years plus forever .
When the template begins to process `` xxx '' then the newline might be seen as an indentation , within the template , so the template would start considering all subsequent lines to be part of the oh so important quotebox , generated now in the middle of the template procedural coding .
So , anyway , put all 3 schidzo languages , blended together , and you get MediaWiki markup ( or markdown ? )
However , some general principles can explain how the problems have arisen , over the years .
The English Wikipedia is impacted because all 200 + languages share some common software , and that software gets changed for everyone .

The tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s .
Tolkien used the tengwar to write texts for his fictional world Middle earth and other things .

But Tolkien used the tengwar mostly for writing English .
The first published sample of tengwar writing was 1937 in The Hobbit , to so called The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription .

Peter Ahlwardts ( `` Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning '' , 1745 ) said people who sought to protect themselves from lightning should go anywhere except in or around a church .
Early on , Christian churches tried to prevent the damage of lightning by prayers .
A lightning rod or lightning conductor is a metal rod that is used to make lightning strike it , rather than strike something else .
Balls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method thought to prevent lightning strikes to ships .
The patent was granted due to a fault in Franklin 's original theory of operation ; the pointed lightning rod actually ionizes the air around itself . This makes the air conductive , which in turn raises the probability of a strike .
Many years after receiving his patent , in 1919 Dr. Tesla wrote an article for The Electrical Experimenter entitled `` Famous Scientific Illusions '' , in which he explains the logic of Franklin 's pointed lightning rod and discloses his improved method and apparatus .
Glass objects do not conduct electricity well . They are seldom struck by lightning .
The church tower was usually the highest structure or building in medieval European towns and villages . It was also the building very often hit by lightning .
In the 19th century the lightning rod became a symbol of American ingenuity and a decorative motif .
Lightning rods were often embellished with ornamental glass balls ( now prized by collectors ) .
The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has also been incorporated into weather vanes .
In the United States , the pointed lightning rod conductor , often incorrectly referred to as the `` lightning attractor , '' was invented by Benjamin Franklin as part of his groundbreaking explorations of electricity .
Lightning can damage structures made of most materials ( masonry , wood , concrete and even steel ) . The huge currents involved can heat materials , and especially water to high temperatures .
Franklin thought that , with an iron rod sharpened to a point at the end ,
The random behavior of lightning ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin 's initial work .
It is part of a lightning protection system .
Franklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment .
Nikola Tesla 's was an improvement in lightning protectors .
Priests prayed , `` temper the destruction of hail and cyclones and the force of tempests and lightning ; check hostile thunders and great winds ; and cast down the spirits of storms and the powers of the air . ''
Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast .
`` The electrical fire would , I think , be drawn out of a cloud silently , before it could come near enough to strike ( ... ) . ''
This experiment , in fact , took place because he was tired of waiting for Christ Church in Philadelphia to be completed so he could place a lightning rod on top of it .
Therefore , goes the theory , there must be something about glass that repels lightning .

`` Owen : the most distinguished vertebrate zoologist and palaeontologist ... but a most deceitful and odious man . ''
A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate sub class of the Mammalia ( see Thomas Henry Huxley ) .
In the second part of his career his reputation slipped .
Also , his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on .
`` It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me '' .
Owen , in Darwin 's opinion , was `` Spiteful , extremely malignant , clever ; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about '' .
This was not the first or last time Owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own , when in fact it was not .
In the first part of his career Owen was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age .
In this Owen had no supporters at all .
Owen credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the Iguanodon , completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur , Gideon Mantell .
Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society 's Zoological Council for plagiarism .
This was not solely due to his underhanded dealings with colleagues ; it was also due to the serious errors of scientific judgement which were discovered and publicized .
Sir Richard Owen KCB ( Lancaster , 20 July 1804 18 December 1892 ) was an English biologist , comparative anatomist and palaeontologist .
Owen was highly critical of Darwin 's On the Origin of Species , in part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution . Instead , Darwin compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible .

Royal Commissions are called to look into very important matters and usually controversy .
For example , these can be about government structure , the treatment of minorities , or the events that had received concern from the public or economic questions .
Because of this governments are usually very careful about framing the Terms of Reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish .
In Australia and particularly New South Wales Royal Commissions have been investigations into police and government corruption and organised crime . They have used the powers of the Royal Commissioner to force powerful , but corrupt , public officials to tell the truth .
In other cases , where the Commissioner has not kept to the terms of reference , the commission has been stopped by a superior court .
In practice unlike other forms of inquiry once a Commission has started the government can not stop it .
The results of Royal Commissions are published in , often , massive reports of findings containing policy recommendations .
They can call witnesses under oath , offer indemnities , seize documents and other evidence ( sometimes including those normally protected , such as classified information ) , holding hearings in camera , and can force all government officials to help the Commission .
Because of their legal powers the Commissioners are often retired senior judges .
They often have long and complex names , for example , the `` Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer '' . Because of this they are commonly known by the name of the main Commissioner .
A Royal Commissioner has a lot of power , more than those of a judge but these are limited to the `` Terms of Reference '' of the Commission .
Royal Commissions are usually run by one or more notable figures .
In states that are Commonwealth Realms a Royal Commission is a major government public inquiry into an important issue .
They have been held in the United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , Kenya and Saudi Arabia .
Many Royal Commissions last many years and , often , a different government is left to respond to the findings .
In Hong Kong , Ireland and South Africa , they are called a Commission of Enquiry or Commission of Inquiry .
These reports are often quite important , with the government making some or all recommendations into law . The work of some Commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government .

The Labor Party had controlled the LCC from 1934 and by the 1950s the Conservative Government considered that elections were becoming one sided , since the London County Council ( LCC ) covered only the inner ( generally Labour voting ) districts .
The Mayor of London elections were won by the same Ken Livingstone , who began his victory speech with the words : `` As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago '' .
In 1999 a referendum was held on the establishment of a new London authority and elected mayor , which was approved by a two to one margin .
The new Greater London Authority ( GLA ) was established in 2000 .
Livingstone 's high spend socialist policies put the GLC into direct conflict with Margaret Thatcher 's Conservative government .
Most of the powers of the GLC were given to the London boroughs .
It replaced the earlier London County Council ( LCC ) which had covered a much smaller area .
The Local Government Act 1985 , which abolished the GLC , faced considerable opposition from many quarters but was narrowly passed in Parliament , setting the end of the council for 31 March 1986 .
The government sought to create a new body covering all of London .
The Greater London Council ( GLC ) was the local government administrative body for Greater London from 1965 to 1986 .
Some powers , such as the fire service , were taken over by joint boards made up of councillors appointed by the boroughs see waste authorities in Greater London for an example .
Livingstone soon became a thorn in the side of the sitting Tory government .
The GLA has a very different structure to the GLC , it consisted of a directly elected Mayor of London and a London Assembly .

The lost energy is converted into heat , raising the temperature of the system .
In Hydrology , dissipation is the process of converting mechanical energy of downward flowing water into thermal and acoustical energy .
Such systems are called dissipative systems .
In computational physics , a numerical dissipation is also known as `` artificial dissipation '' or `` artificial diffusion '' or `` numerical diffusion '' .
Very often these devices look like small waterfalls or cascades , where water flows vertically or over riprap to lose some of its kinetic force .
In physics , dissipation includes the concept of a dynamical system where important mechanical modes , such as waves or oscillations , lose energy over time , typically due to the action of friction or turbulence .
The dissipative nature depends on the nature of the wave : an atmospheric wave , for instance , may dissipate close to the surface due to friction with the land mass , and at higher levels due to radiative cooling .
Various devices are designed in stream beds ( river banks ) to reduce the kinetic energy of flowing waters to reduce their erosive potential on banks and river bottoms .
They all mean this : when the pure advection equation which , by definition , is free of dissipation is solved by a numerical approximation method that reduces the amplitude and changes the shape of the initial wave in a way analogous ( similar ) to a diffusional process , the method is said to contain ` dissipation ' .
For example , a wave that loses amplitude is said to dissipate .

The magnitude of the gradient will determine how fast the temperature rises in that direction .
If a road goes directly up the hill , then the steepest slope on the road will also be 40 % .
Consider a room in which the temperature is given by a scalar field , so at each point the temperature is . We will assume that the temperature does not change in time .
Consider again the example with the hill and suppose that the steepest slope on the hill is 40 % .
Then , at each point in the room , the gradient at that point will show the direction in which the temperature rises most quickly .
Consider a hill whose height above sea level at a point is .
The steepness of the slope at that point is given by the magnitude of the gradient vector .
For example , if the angle between the road and the uphill direction , projected onto the horizontal plane , is 60 Â , then the steepest slope along the road will be 20 % which is 40 % times the cosine of 60 Â .
The gradient of at a point is a vector pointing in the direction of the steepest slope or grade at that point .
A generalization of the gradient , for functions which have vectorial values , is the Jacobian .
If instead , the road goes around the hill at an angle with the uphill direction ( the gradient vector ) , then it will have a shallower slope .
The gradient can also be used to measure how a scalar field changes in other directions , rather than just the direction of greatest change , by taking a dot product .
In vector calculus , the gradient of a scalar field is a vector field which points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar field , and whose magnitude is the greatest rate of change .

GÃ del 's incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems , proved by Kurt GÃ del in 1931 . They are about limitations in all but the most trivial formal systems for arithmetic of mathematical interest .
All axioms are supposed to be true , even without a proof . A theory then serves to come up with other true statements from the axioms , using certain rules .
Most people think they show that Hilbert 's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible . This would give a negative answer to Hilbert 's second problem .
The theorems are very important for the philosophy of mathematics .

Pulitzer changed its focus to human interest stories , scandal , and sensationalism .
Under Pulitzer 's leadership circulation grew from 15,000 to 600,000 , making the New Your World the largest newspaper in the country .
In 1902 , Columbia 's new president Nicholas Murray Butler was more receptive to the plan for a school and prizes , but it would not be until after Pulitzer 's death that this dream would be fulfilled .
Then , in 1878 , he bought the St. Louis Dispatch for $ 2,700 and merged the two papers , which became the St. Louis Post Dispatch , which remains St. Louis ' daily newspaper .
The university initially turned down the money , evidently unimpressed by Pulitzer 's unscrupulous character .

In 1892 , Pulitzer offered Columbia University 's president , Seth Low , money to set up the world 's first school of journalism .
Pulitzer 's already failing health deteriorated rapidly , and he left the newsroom . He continued to actively manage the paper from his vacation retreat in Bar Harbor Maine and his New York mansion .

Jacques Plante holds the record for winning the most Vezinas with seven , trailed by Bill Durnan and Dominik Hasek both of who have won six .
Billy Smith of the New York Islanders was the first winner of the Vezina under the current system .
Hasek has won the most under the current system of honoring the best individual goalie .
The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a new award for the goaltender ( s ) of the team that surrenders the fewest goals in regular season play .
Since 1981 , the Vezina Trophy has been awarded by the NHL General Managers to the most outstanding goaltender .
Before 1981 , it was awarded to the goaltender ( s ) of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the regular season ; now , the William M. Jennings Trophy is awarded under this previous definition .
Chuck Rayner was the only goaltender to win the Hart Memorial Trophy , but never the Vezina .
Players for the Montreal Canadiens have won the Vezina 28 times .

The NHL adopted the current criteria for the Vezina Trophy beginning in 1982 .
The Vezina Trophy is awarded every year to the National Hockey League 's goaltender who is chosen as the best goaltender .
At the end of each season , the 30 General Managers of the teams in the National Hockey League vote to determine the goaltender who was the most valuable to his team during the regular season .
Two other Vezina winning goaltenders have also won the Hart Memorial Trophy : Roy Worters and Al Rollins .

Under the original definition , there would often be multiple winners from the same team during one season .
However , it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence the change was made to offer the William M. Jennings Trophy to the goaltender ( s ) playing for the team with the fewest goals against .
There have been numerous instances of players receiving the trophy many times in different years , and players tying for the trophy .
The Vezina Trophy was named for Georges VÃ zina , a very good goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens .

Zemst is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Flemish Brabant .
One could therefore wonder whether these were medical models , the town of Smyrna being reputed for its medical school .
The style is reminiscent of Pompei and is situated much more on the side of the grand contemporary paintings than on the heritage of the red figure pottery .
These vases are characterized by a base painted pink .
The sculptors , imitating the preceding centuries , portray painful moments rendered expressive with three dimensional compositions , often V shaped , and anatomical hyper realism .
In the great statuary , the artist explores themes such as suffering , sleep or old age .
Recent archeological discoveries at the cemetery of Pagasae ( close to modern Volos ) , at the edge of the Pagasetic Gulf , or again at Vergina ( 1987 ) , in the former kingdom of Macedonia , have brought to light some original works .
The neck is decorated with ornamental motifs while four satyrs in high relief are casually seated on the shoulders of the vase .
However , these newer colors are more delicate and do not support heat .
The Hellenistic period is equally the time of development of the mosaic , particularly with the works of Sosos of Pergamon , active in the 2nd century BC and the only mosaic artist cited by Pliny ( XXXVI , 184 ) .
The painting occurred therefore after firing , contrary to the traditional practice .
Few examples of Greek wall paintings have survived the centuries .
The figurines were equally fashionable .
Their mother Gaia , come to their aid , can do nothing and must watch them twist in pain under the blows of the gods .
The Hellenistic period produced some masterpieces like the Gonzaga cameo , now preserved at the Hermitage Museum .
It concerns cutting in relief on a stone composed of several colored layers , allowing the object to be presented in relief through the effects of color .
It started with a simple fortress on the Acropolis ( a very big rock ) . Different Attalid kings added to it and made a huge group of buildings .
Previously reserved for religious use , in Hellenistic Greece the terra cotta figurine was more frequently used for funerary , and even decorative , purposes .
Pergamon did not distinguish itself with its architecture alone : it was also the seat of a brilliant school of sculpture called Pergamene Baroque .
The most representative copies of this style come from Centuripe in Sicily , where a workshop was active until the 3rd century B.C. .
Molded glass continued , notably in the creation of intaglio jewelry .
The work on metal vases took on a new fullness : the artists competed among themselves with great virtuosity .
It is decorated with a 32 centimetre tall frieze of figures in relief representing Dionysus surrounded by Ariadne and her procession of satyrs and maenads .
Because of this , only the smaller objects still exist .
Artemis Rospigliosi of the Louvre is probably a copy of one of them ; as for copies of the Dying Gaul , they were very numerous in the Roman period .
The Olympians triumph in it , each on his side , over Giants most of which are transformed into savage beasts : serpents , birds of prey , lions or bulls .
The second temple of Apollo at Didyma was like that . It was twenty kilometers from Miletus in Ionia .
The fragility of the pigments preventing frequent use of these vases , they were reserved for use in funerals .
The jewellers of the time excelled at handling details and filigrees : thus , the funeral wreaths present very realistic leaves of trees or stalks of wheat .
The art of glass developed especially in Italy .
The shapes of the vases are also inspired by the tradition of metal : thus with the lagynos ( pictured here ) , a wine jar typical of the period .
In parallel there subsisted a tradition of polychromatic figurative painting : the artists sought a greater variety of tints than in the past .
In it one sees four doves perched on the edge of a basin filled with water .
For example , the tomb said to be that of Philip II has provided a great frieze representing a royal lion hunt , remarkable by its composition , the arrangement of the figures in space and its realistic representation of nature .
Certain mosaics , however , provide a pretty good idea of the `` grand painting '' of the period : these are copies of frescoes .
The `` grotesques '' are equally common at Tarsus and also at Alexandria .
One such is the Barberini Faun of Munich , representing a sleeping satyr with relaxed posture and anxious face , perhaps the prey of nightmares .
The art of engraving on gems hardly advanced at all , limiting itself to mass produced items that lacked originality .
Sometimes , they were reduced to echoing a form from the great sculptures : thus one finds numerous copies in miniature of the Tyche ( good luck ) of Antioch , of which the original dates to the beginning of the 3rd century BC .
It is believed to be a copy of a work described by Pliny the Elder ( XXXV , 110 ) which had been painted by Philoxenus of Eretria for King Cassander of Macedon at the end of the 4th century BC .
Attalus I ( 269 197 BC ) , to commemorate his victory at Caicus against the Gauls â '' called Galatians by the Greeks â '' had two series of votive groups sculpted : the first , consecrated on the Acropolis of Pergamon , includes the famous Gaul killing himself and his wife , of which the original is lost ( the best copy is in the Massimo alle Terme museum of Rome , see illustration ) ; the second group , offered to Athens , is composed of small bronzes of Greeks , Amazons , gods and giants , Persians and Gauls .
The evolution is similar for the art of jewellery .
Fortunately , during Hellenistic Greece , the raw materials were plentiful following eastern conquests .
An example is the Alexander Mosaic , showing the confrontation of the young conqueror and the Grand King Darius III at the Battle of Issus , a mosaic which adorns the walls of the House of the Faun at Pompeii .
Another phenomenon appears in Hellenistic sculpture : privatization , which involves the recapture of older public patterns in decorative sculpture .
The mosaic allows us to admire the choice of colors , the composition of the ensemble with turning movement and facial expressivity .
In Tanagra , in Boeotia , the figurines , full of lively colors , most often represent elegant women in scenes full of charm .
One of them is watering herself while the others seem to be resting , which creates effects of reflections and shadow perfectly studied by the artist .
At Smyrna , in Asia Minor , two major styles occurred side by side : first of all , copies of masterpieces of great sculpture , such as Farnese Hercules in gilt terra cotta .
The refinement of molding techniques made it possible to create true miniature statues , with a high level of detail .
LaocoÃ n , strangled by snakes , tries desperately to loosen their grip without affording a glance at his dying sons .
Many of the large bronze statues were lost with the majority being melted to recover the material .
At Panagyurishte ( now in Bulgaria ) , skilfully sculpted gold vases have been found : on an amphora , two rearing centaurs form the handles .
The drunk woman , also at Munich , portrays without reservation an old woman , thin , haggard , clutching against herself her jar of wine .
In Derveni , not far from Salonica , a tomb has provided a great krater with bronze volutes dating from approximately 320 BC and weighing 40 kilograms ( Derveni krater ) .
As for the portraits , they are tinged with naturalism , under the influence of Roman art .
This type of retrospective style also exists in ceramics .
Pergamon is a very good example of Hellenistic architecture .
As compensation , the cameo made its appearance .
These characteristics are pushed to their peak in the friezes of the Great Altar of Pergamon , decorated under the order of Eumenes II ( 197 159 BC ) with a gigantomachy stretching 110 metres in length , illustrating in the stone a poem composed especially for the court .
A very big theater has benches stretched out over the sides of the hill , for people to sit on , and is able to hold almost 10,000 people .
The figures , often female , are represented in colored clothing : blue violet chiton , yellow himation , white veil .
It was in the Hellenistic period that the Greeks , who until then only knew molded glass , discovered the technique of glass blowing , thus permitting new forms .
Or they could simply be caricatures , designed to provoke laughter .
They represented divinities as well as subjects from contemporary life .
Thus , Venus de Milo , even while echoing a classic model , is distinguished by the twist of her hips .
The expression of sentiments , the forcefulness of details â '' bushy hair and moustaches here â '' and the violence of the movements are characteristic of the Pergamene style .
The Hellenistic period is that of the decline of painting on vases .
One finds also more complex relief , based on animals or mythological creatures .
Thus emerged the theme of the `` negro '' , particularly in Ptolemaic Egypt : these statuettes of Black adolescents were successful up to the Roman period .
The most common vases are black and uniform , with a shiny appearance approaching that of varnish , decorated with simple motifs of flowers or festoons .
In this period the insetting of precious stones flourished .
It is also the period when vases in relief appeared , doubtless in imitation of vases made of precious metals : wreaths in relief were applied to the body of the vase , or again the one shown here received veins or gadroons .
Hellenistic sculpture repeats the innovations of the second classicism : perfect sculpture in the round , allowing the statue to be admired from all angles ; study of draping and effects of transparency of clothing ; suppleness of poses .
It has long been necessary to content oneself with studying the Hellenistic influences in Roman frescoes , for example those of Pompeii or Herculaneum .
Progress in bronze casting made it possible for the Greeks to create large works , such as the Colossus of Rhodes , with a height of 32 meters .

Parasitic wasps are typically parasitoids , and extremely diverse in habits , many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host ( egg or pupa ) , or sometimes paralyzing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor .
Parasitic wasps are increasingly used in agricultural pest control as they prey mostly on pest insects and have little impact on crops .
With most species , adult parasitic wasps themselves do not take any nutrients from their prey , and , much like bees , butterflies , and moths , those that do feed as adults typically derive all of their nutrition from nectar .
The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae are mature , usually dying either when the parasitoids pupate , or when they emerge as adults .
They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the host externally .
Almost every pest insect species has at least one wasp species that preys upon it or parasitizes it , making wasps critically important in natural control of their numbers ( biocontrol ) .
Most wasps are social insects , like bees and ants , but there are a few solitary wasps . Social wasps are formed of paper wasps , yellow jackets and hornets .

Nikolai Suetin used suprematist motifs on works at the St. Petersburg Lomonosov Porcelain Factory where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed , and Malevich designed a suprematist teapot .
This development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state , ideas were in ferment , and the old order was being swept away .
He created a suprematist ` grammar ' based on fundamental geometric forms ; in particular , the square and the circle .
Malevich 's architectural projects were known after 1922 Arkhitektoniki .
`` Black Square '' was painted in 1915 and was a breakthrough in his career and in art in general .
As the new order became established , and Stalinism took hold from 1924 on , the state began limiting the freedom of artists .
Another part of the formalism was low regard for triangles which were dismissed as ancient , pagan , or Christian .
I felt only night within me and it was then that I conceived the new art , which I called Suprematism .
There was some crossover with constructivism , with suprematists such as Lyuba Popova and especially El Lissitzky working on propaganda and industrial design .
Lissitzky spread suprematist ideas abroad in the early 1920s .
Malevich also painted White on White which marked a breakthrough from polychrome to monochrome suprematism .
From the late 1920s the Russian avant garde experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of socialist realism became official policy , and prohibited abstraction and different artistic expression .
Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement , or through time ; titles such as : Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement .
The suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in constructivist architecture .
Designs emphasized the right angle , with similarities to De Stijl and Le Corbusier , and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all .
In 1915 , Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting .
